In order to predict future electricity demand and enhance the power distribution system, analysis and forecasting of energy consumption systems are necessary. Several issues with the present energy consumption prediction methods make it difficult to anticipate actual energy usage with any degree of accuracy. In order to master the energy prediction method, this study examines fourteen years' worth of hourly energy usage data from a Kaggle open source dataset.

In the server selection algorithms, a server is selected to perform a process issued by a client by estimating the electric energy consumption by simulating the execution of every current process. However, it takes time to collect the state of processes performed on each server and estimate the termination time of the processes. In this paper, we propose a simple energy-efficient (PEA) algorithm to select server where only state information on number of processes on each serveris used.

In this paper, we consider a computation process which mainly consumes the central processing unit (CPU) resources. Cooling devices, such as fans, consume the electric power in addition to the CPU of a server. The rotation speed of a fan is revved up in servers in order to decrease the temperature of a server. Thus, the total power consumption of a server depends on not only computational devices such as a CPU, but also cooling devices. We discuss an extended simple power consumption (ESPC) model of a server with a multicore CPU and cooling devices to perform computation type processes. It is critical to discuss how to select a server for each request issued by a client in order to not only achieve performance objectives, but also reduce the total power consumption of a system based on the ESPC model.

Through measuring electric power consumed by types of servers to perform application processes, we newly propose a multi-level power consumption (MLPC) model of a server with a multi-core CPU.

In this paper, we consider storage processes which read and write files in storage devices. The SPCS model (simple power consumption model for a storage server) shows how much electric power a server consumes to perform storage and computation processes. In our macro-level approach, we first measure the electric power consumed by a whole server to perform storage and computation processes and the computation time of each process.

Therefore, it is crucial to monitor and forecast the anomalies in power consumption to avoid any tragedy. In this paper, the authors proposed a method of predicting anomalies in power consumption. The proposed method uses a statistical approach in labeling; the labeled power consumption data are then used to form the data instances. Later, supervised machine learning classification techniques, namely Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, are implemented on the data instances to predict the power consumption anomalies. The experimental results demonstrate that the precision, recall, and F1 score are achieving better results when the training dataset is larger.

However, we see that power and energy are both critical concerns in High performance computing applications. One of the biggest challenges in HPC is power efficiency. Power and energy consumption has to be minimized to reduce the cost without much change in the performance of the application. One basic requirement to achieve this power efficiency is to measure the power consumption of application runs. If we cannot identify the power profile of an application, improvising the power utilization becomes more challenging. Although, external electronic watt meters exist to perform the analysis, software techniques to detect the power usage have been found to be more convenient for dynamic runs of the application. Also, the use of external hardware implies extra costs. Additionally, power has to be supplied to the device for its operation. Previous efforts to develop such a system have involved the use of expensive and bulky hardware technology and software applications that are not very accurate. We propose a software tool named PHOENIX that measures the power consumption and identifies the power profiles of the applications. The results are validated using a hardware power meter. We use rodinia benchmark suite to verify our results. Our results show that we achieve an average of 88% accuracy when compared to hardware power meter.","","978-1-5090-1987-8","10.1109/INFOSCI.2016.7845334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7845334","High Performance Computing;Power efficiency;Power profiling","Hardware;Power measurement;Power demand;Software measurement;Random access memory;Software tools","parallel processing;power aware computing;software tools","PHOENIX;software tool;power consumption;power profiles;high performance computing;HPC;power efficiency;energy consumption;software techniques;power usage;hardware power meter;rodinia benchmark suite","","","","17","IEEE","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In industry, it is a challenge for them to develop an energy efficient product while meeting customer expectation. In previous study, there is lack of method that uses software metrics to measure power consumption of mobile applications. In this paper we have identified several software metrics that can be used as indicator to measure mobile application power consumption. The objective of this study is to which identify software metrics is suitable act as indicators to measure power consumption of mobile applications. This can help mobile software designer to measure power used for their mobile applications in the early design phase. In order to prove this concept, we randomly select two open source mobile applications as our case study. The power used of a mobile application is collected by using Trepn Profiler (Power profiling tool for Qualcomm processor CPU). We capture the actual power consumption and estimated power consumption (without calculate Android OS and profiling tool power) with the profiler. There are overall 18 available metrics based on Object-Oriented Metrics. We map the 18 metrics with the power consumption captured by Trepn Profiler. The results shown that McCabe cyclomatic complexity, number of parameters, nested block depth, weighted methods per class, number of overridden method, number of methods, total lines of code and method lines have significant relationship with power consumption of mobile application. Therefore, these eight metrics can be used as the indicator to measure mobile applications' power consumption.","","978-1-4673-8227-4","10.1109/MySEC.2015.7475216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7475216","Android Mobile Application;Power Consumption;Metric;Power Measurement","Mobile applications;Power demand;Software metrics;Energy consumption;Power measurement","embedded systems;energy conservation;green computing;mobile computing;power consumption;public domain software;software metrics","software metrics;power consumption measurement;mobile devices battery capacity;green mobile applications;energy efficiency;energy restricted embedded system;open source mobile applications;Trepn Profiler;power profiling tool;Qualcomm processor CPU;object-oriented metrics;McCabe cyclomatic complexity;parameter number;nested block depth;weighted methods per class;overridden method number;method number;code total lines","","3","","23","IEEE","23 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to create a smart city, it is important to reduce energy and manage it efficiently. With the development of smart city, it is expected that a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be installed in various buildings in the city, and a lot of energy usage information will be measured. When many IoT devices are connected to the internet, a large amount of data is generated. Therefore, when the existing cloud service is used, data is delayed in analyzing and transmitting data, and it becomes impossible to receive the analysis result quickly. With edge computing, you can process data directly in the edge environment where data is collected and apply the results quickly to the field. It can respond to data much faster than it can deliver data and wait for the results to be analyzed and reduce the load on the data.

Therefore, it is important to judge and control the errors of each edge in such a system, which puts a load on the embedded system of small edges. However, it is not easy to judge an error in an embedded system with limitations of performance. In such a system, we try to determine the state of the edge device using power consumption data and determine the error based on it. In this paper, we show that the server can determine errors using the power consumption data, and the data consumption allows the server to read data values through data communication using QR codes. In this architecture, the edge device only transmits power consumption data to reduce the load on the embedded system, and the gateway and server collect the data using QR codes communication. At the same time, the server interprets the received data to determine errors using various algorithms and controls the edge device. In this process, it is important to synchronize the edge device with the gateway and the server. Since the proposed structure uses a separate power meter and communication device, it solves the problem of not sending an appropriate message to the server when a communication error occurs at the previous edge. Also, the proposed model solves the overload problem that occurs when networks are used in various IoT devices using QR code that imaged data and light communication using a camera. After data is extracted and sorted from the QR code obtained by recognizing the camera of the intermediate server, the main server performs error determination through data analysis. The proposed architecture was implemented using `chip-whisperer' to measure edges and data, as well as `raspberry pi' to implement the server. As a result, the proposed architecture server showed successful data transmission and error determination, and it also showed very little additional load at the edge.","","978-1-7281-9161-4","10.1109/ICEIC51217.2021.9369725","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025109); Ministry of Education, Korea(grant numbers:21A20131600011); IC Design Education Center(IDEC), Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9369725","Robust Execution;Embedded system;Error detection;QRcode;Data transmission","Performance evaluation;Power demand;Embedded systems;Image edge detection;Computer architecture;Servers;Data communication","cameras;computerised monitoring;data analysis;data communication;embedded systems;image recognition;Internet of Things;power aware computing;power consumption;power meters;QR codes","Raspberry Pi;light communication;software execution;QR code communication;data transmission;architecture server;data analysis;error determination;imaged data;IoT devices;communication error;communication device;power meter;data communication;power consumption data;embedded system;IoT edge devices;QR code-based power consumption profile;remote monitoring systems","","2","","14","IEEE","10 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the historical electricity data, the quantile regression neural network model (qrnn) and kernel density estimation method are used for power interval prediction. Using the quantile regression to study the relationship between the independent variable and the conditional quantile of the dependent variable, the quantile regression neural network is used to obtain the predicted values of the different quantile points at the same time point. The kernel density estimation method can be based on different points to construct power forecast interval. The interval prediction result at the future time point can be compared with true power consumption whether the power consumption of the large user is abnormal and analyze the future power consumption trend of the large user, and provide decision support for the stable operation of the power grid.","2473-3547","978-1-5386-8527-3","10.1109/ISCID.2018.10169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8695577","Interval prediction;Quantile regression neural network;Kernel density estimation","Neural networks;Kernel;Estimation;Predictive models;Power demand;Forecasting","estimation theory;forecasting theory;load forecasting;neural nets;power consumption;power engineering computing;power grids;regression analysis","predicted values;kernel density estimation method;power forecast interval;future time point;future power consumption trend;power grid;power consumption interval prediction;power forecasting;gird construction planning;power demand management;power data;historical electricity data;quantile regression neural network model;power interval prediction;conditional quantile;quantile points;point prediction model","","","","14","IEEE","25 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

I will first present the task-dependent hot spot or heat sources identification for multi-core processors based on measured thermal maps. In our work, instead of using traditional functional unit powers as input, the new models are directly based on the on-chip real-time high level chip utilizations and thermal sensor information of commercial chips without any assumption of additional physical sensors requirement. We first framed the problem as the static or transient mapping between the chip utilizations and thermal maps. To build the transient thermal model, we utilized temporal-aware long-short-term-memory (LSTM) neural networks with system-level variables such as chip frequency, voltage, and instruction counts as inputs. Instead of a pixel-wise heatmap estimation, we used 2D spatial discrete cosine transformation (DCT) on the heatmaps so that they can be expressed with just a few dominant DCT coefficients. Second, we explored generative learning for the full-chip thermal map estimation problem. In our work, we treated the thermal modeling problem as an image-generation problem using the generative neural networks. The resulting thermal map estimation method, called ThermGAN can provide tool-accurate full-chip transient thermal maps from the given performance monitor traces of commercial off-the-shelf multi-core processors. Third, I will present a new full-chip power map estimation method for commercial multi-core processors. We proposed to use a simple first-principle based 2D spatial Laplace method to generate the power maps from the measured or simulated thermal maps. Then I will show how we can obtain the thermal map estimation for multi-processor chips under practical heat sink cooling conditions in which no thermal maps can be measured.","","978-1-6654-9747-3","10.1109/IPDPSW55747.2022.00202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9835300","","Estimation;Multicore processing;Transient analysis;Thermal management;Semiconductor device measurement;Integrated circuit modeling;Heating systems","cooling;discrete cosine transforms;heat sinks;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;recurrent neural nets;thermal management (packaging)","pixel-wise heatmap estimation;2D spatial discrete cosine transformation;generative learning;full-chip thermal map estimation problem;thermal modeling problem;image-generation problem;generative neural networks;off-the-shelf multicore processors;full-chip power map estimation method;commercial multicore processors;2D spatial Laplace method;multiprocessor chips;EDAML 2022;power monitoring;machine learning;power density map estimation methods;commercial multicore CPUs;task-dependent hot spot;measured thermal maps;on-chip real-time high level chip utilizations;thermal sensor information;commercial chips;physical sensors requirement;static mapping;transient mapping;transient thermal model;long-short-term-memory neural networks;chip frequency;functional unit powers;thermal monitoring;UC Riverside;simulated thermal maps;tool-accurate full-chip transient thermal maps;DCT coefficients;temporal-aware long-short-term-memory neural networks;LSTM","","","","","IEEE","1 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Researchers have already studied in depth each of those fields, including for instance a long monitoring processes of various number of individual ICT equipment from where power models are constructed. With the development of smart intelligent meters and emerging protocols such as SNMP and NETCONF, currently there is an open field to couple the power models, translated to the expected behavior of the devices, with the realtime energy measurements. The goal is to derive a comparison on the power data between those parameters in the direction of detection for possible deviations on the expected results. The logical assumption is that a detected fault in the usage of a particular device will not only increase its own energy usage, but also may cause additional consumption on the other devices part of the network. This paper shows the opportunities to use power consumption monitoring of an ICT infrastructure as a substitute for the classical NMS. A platform is developed to monitor and analyze the retrieved power data of a simulated enterprise ICT infrastructure. Moreover, smart algorithms are developed which are aware of the different states that are occurring on each device during their typical use phase. Hence, the platform is able to detect and isolate possible anomalies, for instance improper use of the networking devices. The produced results are obtained and validated with the use of Cisco switches and routers, Dell Precision stations and Raritan PDU as part of the monitored infrastructure.","","978-1-5090-4052-0","10.1109/FiCloud.2016.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7575890","Energy efficiency;Network management system;Energy metrics and benchmarks;Performance evaluation and modelling;Performance monitoring;Fault detection and isolation","Monitoring;Energy consumption;Real-time systems;Protocols;Power demand;Energy efficiency;Analytical models","energy conservation;fault diagnosis;information technology;power aware computing;process monitoring;smart meters","Raritan PDU;Dell precision stations;Cisco routers;Cisco switches;fault isolation;smart algorithms;ICT infrastructure power consumption monitoring;fault detection;power data;realtime energy measurements;smart intelligent meter development;ICT equipment monitoring processes;network management systems;network devices;network protocols;energy efficient policies;information and communication technology;ICT enterprise usage monitoring;ICT energy consumption","","4","","22","IEEE","26 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address the weaknesses of OpenGL, Vulkan was proposed as a thin graphics API to reduce the overhead and allow developers to gain grainer control over rendering process. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation on the performance and energy efficiency of OpenGL and Vulkan on a graphics rendering server.

Server cluster systems are equipped with virtual machines to provide applications with scalable and fault-tolerant services. Scalable and fault-tolerant application services can be provided by balancing processing load among virtual machines to perform application processes. On the other hand, a large amount of electric energy is consumed in a server cluster system since multiple virtual machines are performed on multiple servers which consume electric energy to perform application processes. In order to design and implement an energy-aware server cluster system, the computation model and power consumption model of a server to perform application processes on multiple virtual machines have to be defined. In this paper, we first define the computation model of a virtual machine to perform application processes.

While most of the computation currently resides in the cloud, it is desirable to embed DNN processing locally near the sensor due to privacy, security, and latency concerns or limitations in communication bandwidth. Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in the research community to design energy-efficient DNNs. However, estimating energy consumption from the DNN model is much more difficult than other metrics such as storage cost (model size) and throughput (number of operations). This is due to the fact that a significant portion of the energy is consumed by data movement, which is difficult to extract directly from the DNN model. This work proposes an energy estimation methodology that can estimate the energy consumption of a DNN based on its architecture, sparsity, and bitwidth. This methodology can be used to evaluate the various DNN architectures and energy-efficient techniques that are currently being proposed in the field and guide the design of energy-efficient DNNs. We have released an online version of the energy estimation tool at energyestimation.mit.edu.

This project targets domestic usage which has a more direct approach in changing the way we consume energy. In this project we take up House Hold Loads as the application but this project can also be applied for large industrial loads. Smart energy metering and normalized energy data on load usage are one of the major goal setters for the future smart grid and improved energy efficiency in smart homes. Load Monitoring (LM) is essential for energy management and cost fixing. To obtain appliance-specific energy consumption statistics that can further be used to formulate load scheduling strategies for optimal energy utilization, disaggregation of Load is essential. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an alternative and best method for Load Disaggregation, as it can distinguish devices from the aggregated data measured at only a centralized location. In this paper we provide an experimental idea of using NILM technology by actually implementing sub-metering system for each load to forecast its futuristic development on the basis of bin packing algorithms and feedback systems controlled by the Machine Learning Algorithm to end up with an energy efficient smart home and smart grids.","","978-1-5090-4083-4","10.1109/ICDMAI.2017.8073480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8073480","Machine Learning;Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring;Load Disaggregation;Bin Packing;Energy Management;Feedback Systems;Power Quality;Graphic User Interface","Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Fans;Home appliances;MATLAB;Energy management","bin packing;building management systems;domestic appliances;energy conservation;energy consumption;energy management systems;load management;power generation scheduling;power meters;smart power grids","smart grids;energy efficient smart home;feedback systems;bin packing algorithms;Load Disaggregation;NonIntrusive Load Monitoring;optimal energy utilization;load scheduling strategies;appliance-specific energy consumption statistics;load usage;normalized energy data;smart energy metering;industrial loads;electrical energy;smart energy management;user behavior","","11","","7","IEEE","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the multi-level power consumption (MLPC) model of a server with a multi-core CPU, the power consumption of the server depends on the number of active cores and active threads where at least one application process is performed. In our previous studies, we discuss the energy-aware (EA) selection algorithm to select a server for each request process. Here, a server which is expected to consume the minimum electric energy is selected in a cluster. A server consumes the basic electric power even if no process is performed. The ratio of the basic energy consumption to the total electric energy consumption is large, e.g. 40 to 50 %. In this paper, we newly propose a globally energy-aware (GEA) algorithm to select a server for each process in a cluster. Here, not only the total electric energy consumption of the servers but also the ratio of basic electric energy consumed by servers to the total energy consumption can be reduced. We evaluate the GEA algorithm and show not only the total energy consumption of the servers but also the average execution time of processes are reduced in the GEA algorithm compared with the EA, round-robin (RR), and random (RD) algorithms.","","978-1-4799-9942-2","10.1109/NBiS.2015.10","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350596","Multi-level power consumption (MLPC) model;Multi-level computation (MLC) model;Globally energy-aware (GEA) server selection algorithm;Minimum power consumption","Servers;Power demand;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Clustering algorithms;Instruction sets","information systems;power aware computing","multilevel power consumption model;MLPC model;electric power consumption reduction;multicore CPU;globally energy-aware algorithm;GEA algorithm;information system","","42","","15","IEEE","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our previous studies, the improved power consumption laxity based (IPCLB) algorithm to select a server is proposed so that the total power consumption in a cluster of servers can be reduced. Here, if a server stops while a request from a client is performed, the client cannot receive a reply of the request and might be suspended.

While the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm was made primarily to deal with the tedious management issue by placing all control functionality on the controllers, this results in the controller being loaded with tasks and ends up consuming a greater amount of energy for managing the network. This leads to an increased cost for managing the network. Many works have tried to compare the performance of SDN controllers, while only few have considered the energy efficiency. However, the energy efficiency of SDN controllers when subjected to different topologies remains an open issue. This paper looked at the energy efficiency of five SDN controllers using different topologies. Mininet is used for topology emulation and Powerstat for the power consumption readings of the controllers. The results of this study show that POX and RYU controllers perform better than Beacon, Floodlight and OpenDaylight controllers in the achieved energy efficiency for all the topologies considered.","","978-1-7281-6770-1","10.1109/icABCD49160.2020.9183851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183851","Control plane;Energy-efficiency;Network controllers;C-bench;Software defined networks","Servers;Energy efficiency;Topology;Network topology;Control systems;Software defined networking;Emulation","energy conservation;power consumption;software defined networking;telecommunication computing;telecommunication control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication power management","software defined networking controllers;network deployments;network management;software defined networking paradigm;tedious management issue;control functionality;SDN controllers;topology emulation;energy efficiency;connected devices;Powerstat;power consumption;POX controllers;RYU controllers;Mininet","","1","","24","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, those MACs become meaningless (zeroes) after rectified linear unit when the convolution results become negative. In this paper, we present an efficient approach to predict and skip the convolutions generating zero outputs. The proposed two-step zero prediction approach, called mosaic CNN, can be effectively used for trading off classification accuracy for computation energy in CNN. In the mosaic CNN, the outputs of each convolutional layer are computed considering their spatial surroundings in an output feature map. Here, the types of spatial surroundings (mosaic types) can be selected to save computation energy at the expense of accuracy.

In battery-powered environments, such as mobile and pervasive systems, efficiency with respect to energy consumption has increasingly been recognized as an important quality attribute. In this paper, we present a framework that (1) facilitates early estimation of the energy consumption induced by an architectural style in a distributed software system, and (2) consequently enables an engineer to use energy consumption estimates along with other quality attributes in determining the most appropriate style for a given distributed application. We have applied the framework on five distributed systems styles to date, and have evaluated it for precision and accuracy using a particular middleware platform that supports the implementation of those styles. In a large number of application scenarios, our framework exhibited excellent precision, in that it was consistently able to correctly rank the five styles and estimate the relative differences in their energy consumptions. Moreover, the framework has also proven to be accurate: its estimates were within 7% of the different style implementations ' actually measured energy consumptions.","","978-0-7695-3092-5","10.1109/WICSA.2008.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459169","Architectural styles;energy estimation;component-based distributed systems","Software systems;Energy consumption;Middleware;Software architecture;Application software;Connectors;Power engineering and energy;Energy measurement;Publish-subscribe;Peer to peer computing","energy consumption;middleware;software architecture","distributed software system;energy consumption;architectural style;mobile systems;pervasive systems;middleware platform","","9","","13","IEEE","3 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An Internet-based data acquisition system requires at least one PC as the central server. The system needs to be run for a long time. If few data are transferred, the server stays at an almost idle state. However, keeping the server running without doing anything wastes power. Reducing this unnecessary power consumption by a PC-based server and further reducing the power consumption of an entire system are the goals of this work. This work is based on a microcontroller-based device. The novel microcontroller-based device in this work is called a Server Agent. This agent receives data from clients while the original PC-based server is off. After the amount of data transferred exceeds a certain limit, the Server Agent powers on the PC-based server and dumps the data to the PC-based server. The Server Agent will power off the PC-based server again once all data are dumped. The power consumed by the Server Agent is <;1 watt, much lower than that consumed by the PC-based server of 60-110 watts. This process reduces system power consumption.","2324-8017","978-1-4244-5568-3","10.1109/3CA.2010.5533780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5533780","data acquisition system;power consumption;Internet;server agent;microcontroller","Web server;Internet;Data acquisition;Network servers;Energy consumption;Microcontrollers;Communication system control;Power engineering computing;Centralized control;Automatic control","client-server systems;data acquisition;electronic data interchange;Internet;microcomputers;microcontrollers;power consumption","power consumption;personal computer based server;Internet based data acquisition system;microcontroller based device;Server Agent;data transfer","","3","","2","IEEE","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our analysis of energy trends indicates three important observations: 1) Energy efficiency due to geometrical scaling is slowing down; 2) The energy efficiency at the bit-level does not translate into efficiency at the instruction-level, or at the system-level for a variety of systems, especially for large-scale AI/ML accelerators or supercomputers; 3) At the application level, general-purpose AI/ML methods can be computationally energy intensive, off-setting the gains in energy from geometrical scaling and special purpose accelerators.

As it is a more recent abstraction, little is known about energy consumption of Software Transactional Memories (STM). In this context, this work presents an analysis and characterization of energy consumption and performance of four Transactional Memory libraries: TL2, Tiny STM, Swiss TM, and Adapt STM, using the STAMP benchmarks. Although most works in the state-of-the-art chose to evaluate Transactional Memories through simulation, in this work the benchmarks are run in actual computers, avoiding the known issues with modeling power consumption in simulators. Our results show that Swiss TM is the most efficient library of the four in terms of energy consumption and performance for the default configurations, followed by Adapt STM, Tiny STM, and TL2, for most of the execution scenarios and 8 threads at most. STM's scalability is directly tied to the strategies for detection and resolution of conflicts. In this perspective, Adapt STM is the best STM for applications with short transactions, Swiss TM presents the best results for medium transactions, and long transactions with medium/high contention are best handled by TL2. On the other hand, Tiny STM shows the worst scalability for most scenarios, but with good results for applications with very small abort rates.","","978-1-4673-8621-0","10.1109/SBAC-PADW.2015.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7423173","Software transactional memory;transactional memory;green computing","Energy consumption;Benchmark testing;Software;Scalability;Memory management;Libraries;Genomics","concurrency (computers);energy consumption;green computing","energy consumption;scalability evaluation;software transactional memory;concurrent programming abstraction;transactional memory libraries;TL2;Tiny STM;Swiss TM;Adapt STM;STAMP benchmarks;medium transactions;long transactions","","1","","25","IEEE","3 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A dynamic prediction model that can adapt itself to changes in the energy consumption pattern is desirable especially for short-term energy prediction. It is also important for an on-line running of the metering system. Two methods of weights update are proposed and tested, namely the accumulative training and sliding window training.

Hydrogen energy has the advantage of low carbon dioxide emission and the ability to generate a lot of energy per weight. However, gaseous hydrogen has a low hydrogen storage density per unit volume, so a liquefaction process is required. Liquid hydrogen has a lower pressure than hydrogen in gaseous state, so the risk of explosion is low and transportation cost is reduced because it is easy to transport in large quantities. Therefore, the hydrogen liquefaction process is important and can improve energy efficiency. Specific Energy Consumption (SEC), commonly used as a performance indicator in the hydrogen liquefaction process, is the sum of energy consumed in the entire process to liquefy 1 kg of hydrogen. However, since the uncertainty of the attribute values lowers the accuracy of prediction, in order to overcome this issue, this study proposes a framework for predicting the SEC value according to the attribute value using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on quantum mechanics. The attribute values corrected through quantum mechanics more closely simulate the attribute of the data and contribute to improving the prediction accuracy.","","978-1-6654-9924-8","10.1109/SCISISIS55246.2022.10001902","National Research Foundation; Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10001902","Deep Neural Network;Stochastic Processes;Quantum Mechanics;Specific Energy Consumption Prediction;Hydrogen Liquefaction Process","Deep learning;Energy consumption;Uncertainty;Oils;Hydrogen;Neural networks;Quantum mechanics","air pollution control;deep learning (artificial intelligence);energy conservation;energy consumption;fossil fuels;hydrogen storage;liquefaction;power engineering computing;quantum theory","deep neural network;DNN;energy efficiency;energy supply methods;fossil fuels;hydrogen energy;hydrogen liquefaction process;hydrogen storage density;low carbon dioxide emission;mass 1.0 kg;quantum mechanics;specific energy consumption prediction","","","","8","IEEE","4 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome such limitations Machine Learning (ML) is used, which can learn from the previous design data and can apply it to the unknown design given to it. In this context, the paper proposes the use of the regression technique of ML to estimate the power consumption of the MOSFET-based digital circuits. For this purpose, to train the ML-based regressor model, a dataset is created from the PMOS based Resistive Load Inverter (RLI), NMOS based RLI, and CMOS-based NAND gate layout. For the formation of the dataset, a 90nm MOS technology node is used and it inculcates the features like capacitance, resistance, number of MOSFET, their respective width and length, and the average power consumption of the respective layout. The regressor model used to predict the power consumption in this work is linear regressor, polynomial regressor, random forest regressor, decision tree regressor, and the extra tree regressor. At last, from the experimental results, it is observed that the extra tree regressor performs better for the RLI circuits with the MSE value of $4.02\times 10^{-10}$ and $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ value of 0.61, and for the NAND gate, the polynomial linear regressor excels with the MSE value of $7.27\times 10^{-10}$ and $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ value of 0.65.","2640-5768","978-1-6654-4290-9","10.1109/AISP53593.2022.9760542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9760542","Machine Learning;VLSI;Power Consumption;Design Automation;EDA","Semiconductor device modeling;Maximum likelihood estimation;Power demand;Signal processing algorithms;Logic gates;Prediction algorithms;Integrated circuit modeling","circuit analysis computing;CMOS logic circuits;decision trees;integrated circuit design;learning (artificial intelligence);logic design;logic gates;MOSFET circuits;nanoelectronics;power consumption;regression analysis","power consumption prediction;Machine Learning;Integrated Circuits;ICs;circuit design flow;design data;regression technique;MOSFET-based digital circuits;ML-based regressor model;Resistive Load Inverter;NMOS based RLI;CMOS-based NAND gate layout;respective width length;average power consumption;polynomial regressor;random forest regressor;decision tree regressor;extra tree regressor;RLI circuits;polynomial linear regressor;electronic design tool;MOS technology node;PMOS based resistive load inverter;linear regressor;size 90.0 nm","","1","","15","IEEE","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Real-time power monitoring is essential for power management and intelligent cooling provisioning and is motivated by the fact that the energy costs for many classes of servers now exceeds the initial hardware costs for the servers. The conventional approach for dynamic power monitoring requires installing hardware Power Distribution Units (PDUs) for all the servers in a datacenter, which is tedious and costly when newer data centers house up to thousands of servers. PDUs require more space in densely cramped data centers, require disruption of business-critical servers (in existing data centers) for attachment to the PDUs, and diminishes overall data center reliability (additional layer of hardware in series with the servers that can degrade in service). Oracle has introduced an innovation called Intelligent Power Monitoring (IPM), which provides accurate, real-time power utilization for servers as a function of customer load fluctuations, fan speed variations, dynamic reconfiguration events under virtualization tiers, failover events for redundant power supplies, and during times when power management features in the CPUs are performing power-capping and/or thermal-capping roles.","","978-1-4799-3372-3","10.1109/E3S.2013.6705857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705857","","","computer centres;cooling;network servers;power aware computing;power measurement;reliability","intelligent power monitoring;intelligent power management;dynamic power utilization monitoring;enterprise computer servers;large-scale data centers;intelligent cooling provisioning;energy costs;hardware costs;dynamic power monitoring;hardware power distribution units;PDUs;business-critical servers;data center reliability;IPM;customer load fluctuation function;fan speed variations;dynamic reconfiguration events;virtualization tiers;failover events;redundant power supplies;CPUs;thermal-capping roles;power-capping","","3","","3","IEEE","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces an IC energy estimation approach, which instead of sequentially propagating workload vectors throughout the circuit, relies on an one time propagation of the workload statistics. To this end, the basic gates need be SPICE pre-characterized with respect to (w.r.t.) static and dynamic energy consumption per input transition type and Neural Network based gate models constructed and trained in order to estimate gate output statistics and consumed energy based on gate input statistics, i.e., the `0' → `0', `0' → `1', `1' → `0', and `1' → `1' transition probabilities. Both pre-characterization and training are done once per technology node and do not contribute to the actual evaluation time. In this way, regardless of n, the number of workload input vectors, by propagating signal statistics instead of logic values the overall circuit energy consumption is evaluated in one instead of n circuit traversals. Moreover, as opposed to the constant and equal gate delay assumption utilized in state of the art energy estimation methods, the proposed approach takes into account the real gate propagation delays, which yields estimates that are closer to the actual energy figures. We evaluated with the proposed method the static and dynamic energy consumption for a set of ISCAS'85 circuits and a 10, 508-gate hashing circuit, using TSMC 40nm CMOS technology, and 50, 000-vector workloads. The experiments indicate that our method provides an estimation error below 2.6% and 1.5% for dynamic and static energy, respectively, when compared to the accurate SPICE measurements, while providing an estimation speedup in the order of 50, 000x.","","978-1-5090-5052-9","10.1109/SMACD.2017.7981598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7981598","Energy Estimation;Neural Networks","Logic gates;Artificial neural networks;Estimation;Energy consumption;Training;SPICE;Probability","CMOS digital integrated circuits;energy consumption;integrated circuit reliability;logic gates;nanoelectronics;neural chips;probability;SPICE;statistical analysis","workload-level neural network;energy consumption estimation;nanoscale IC energy estimation;design-time desideratum;area-delay-power-reliability optimized circuits;workload statistics;dynamic energy consumption;neural network based gate models;gate output statistics;gate input statistics;transition probabilities;propagating signal statistics;logic values;circuit energy consumption;circuit traversals;equal gate delay assumption;art energy estimation methods;ISCAS'85 circuits;10,508-gate hashing circuit;TSMC;CMOS technology;50,000-vector workloads;estimation error;SPICE measurements;size 40 nm","","","","12","IEEE","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research, we model software systems as complex networks, assuming that there is a nonlinear function relation between network characteristics of software and its energy consumption. Based on this assumption, we propose a software energy consumption estimation model at architecture-level. First we measure five network characteristics of software, and then use extreme learning machine (ELM) to fit the relation between network characteristics of software and its energy consumption.

This paper describes a neural-network based model for fine-grain, accurate and low-cost power estimation. The main novelty of the proposed approach is its portability. The methodology can be adopted to predict power consumption not only on a range of current processors but future architectures as well. This portability is achieved by taking advantage of performance monitoring units (PMU) available on current systems and applying a carefully constructed sequence of feature selection techniques. We evaluate our models along several dimensions on multiple platforms.

As these devices are severely resource-constrained, choosing a suitable cryptographic system is challenging.

Smart meters provide information at the consumer level, which could be used as the main source for real-time energy micro-transactions, however, one of the main concerns about direct transactions is information security. Conventional electricity markets rely on centralized information exchange, nevertheless, when intra-day, distributed, electricity consumption and production exchanges are required between customers, this approach might not be enough. This paper presents a proof-of-concept for using Blockchain as a tool for managing the operational transactions in a DC microgrid. The distributed nature of this technology provides an inherently safer approach, by providing an immutable database for transaction history. One of the challenges of using this technology, however, is the required computing power at the nodes and the limited capacity available in the smart meter. To overcome these issues, the authors used a distributed computing technology, -edge computing-, where computation and storage are located closer to the customer, to improve response times by handling the required computational tasks of the Blockchain tool. This approach proved not only to be practically viable but also, offers important insights about the scalability and capabilities of the technology.","","978-1-6654-2935-1","10.1109/TESC50295.2020.9656872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656872","Microgrids;Blockchain;Edge Computing;Smart Grids;DER","Transactive energy;Object oriented modeling;Computational modeling;Microgrids;Libraries;Smart meters;Blockchains","distributed power generation;power consumption;power markets;renewable energy sources","distributed energy resources parameter monitoring;microgrids;increased share;distributed renewable energy sources;flexible tools;reliable electricity;cheap electricity;smart meter;consumer level;real-time energy microtransactions;direct transactions;information security;conventional electricity markets;centralized information exchange;intra-day;electricity consumption;production exchanges;operational transactions;DC microgrid;inherently safer approach;transaction history;required computing power;distributed computing technology;edge computing;response times;required computational tasks;Blockchain tool","","1","","24","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the objective of the cloud computing ecosystem is to move computation and processing away towards a centralized environment, the fallout lies in the power and energy consumption of these infrastructures. Reducing power consumption is an essential requirement for Cloud resource providers to decrease operating costs. One of the options to reduce power consumption is to reduce the number of servers in IDLE (unused) state— as these IDLE servers consume as much as 60% of peak power. Number of servers in IDLE state can be reduced by turning off IDLE servers or transitioning these IDLE servers to low power SLEEP state. With virtualization being the backbone to provision cloud computing services, we use simulation to study and report the impact of using SLEEP state on the server with its virtual machines (VM) servicing application workload requests. We look at two parameters: a) power consumption of the cloud computing environment, b) average response time per request. Our simulation results show that using SLEEP state at server level, and the server with its VMs' servicing application workload requests, we can achieve a 2% savings in average power usage and around 27% savings in average response time per request.","2155-2509","978-1-4673-0298-2","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151371","Power Aware Computing;Server power states;Virtualized environment","Servers;Power demand;Time factors;Process control;Turning;Switches;Cloud computing","cloud computing;computer centres;network servers;power consumption;telecommunication services;virtual machines","power server sleep state transition;power consumption;virtualized server cluster environment;data center;cloud computing ecosystem;energy consumption;IDLE server consumption;virtual machine servicing application;VM servicing application","","4","","11","IEEE","13 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a new challenge in wireless sensor design. In our project we are proposing an ultra-sonic measurement system to find malfunctions within structures. Examples of such structures are aircraft bodies and the wings of a wind turbine. It is required to allow for long term monitoring from a single battery or even using energy scavenging techniques. First of all the measurement algorithms are analyzed. Here we have to find a trade-off between energy consumption of the sensor, required memory size, computational power; duty cycle and timing jitter between actuator and sensors. Most important method to control the energy consumption of the system is an efficient duty cycle control. As most of the time the sensor is sleeping the overall timing of the system has to be maintained and refreshed in a continuous manner. A high timing accuracy results also in higher power consumption during sleep mode, while a low power RC oscillator needs a higher refresh rate. For the wireless system we need to trade-off between power consumption during active mode and data rates. While we are able to transfer more data in a shorter period of time with a high performance system, the overall energy consumption with low data rates could be higher if the on-time of the RF (radio-frequency) frontends is much longer even if the RF-frontends consumes less power in a low data rate mode. In the paper and presentation the use cases and design decision are described based on the outcome of the system analysis.","1558-1101","978-3-9810801-6-2","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457122","","Hardware;Software design;Condition monitoring;Energy consumption;Wireless sensor networks;Battery charge measurement;Control systems;Timing;Radio frequency;Aircraft","computerised monitoring;condition monitoring;hardware-software codesign;power aware computing;ultrasonic applications;wireless sensor networks","hardware-software design challenges;low power sensor nodes;condition monitoring;structural health monitoring;wireless sensor design;ultrasonic measurement system;memory size requirement;computational power;timing jitter;energy consumption;duty cycle control;radiofrequency;RF-frontends","","2","","","","29 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is entirely unnecessary as the work performed by these computers can be done by any other low-power computing devices like thin clients or other small single-board computers. Based on this situation, the problem was identified, which was to evaluate the reduction of power consumption possible by using Low-power computing devices instead of traditional desktop computers in hospital receptions, pathology, and hospital wards. Other research studies also did a similar kind of work comparing power consumption between regular and single-board computers. Data were collected from several hospitals after visiting and observing the computer usage and hardware information used there. Alongside, the power consumption was also collected. The power consumed by a similar single-board computer, a Raspberry Pi-based system that can replace the hospital's computer system infrastructure, was also compared. It was found that a Raspberry Pi-based system can perform the same tasks consuming 4.2 times less energy than the current system. Finally, as future work, we can expand our study to other sectors like banks and offices where the existing system can be replaced with a Low-power Computing device-based system.

Network-aware Virtual Machine (NVM) placement and migration is developing as a very favorable technique for the optimization of compute network resource utilization, energy consumption, and network traffic minimization. Thus, NVM operation guarantees a fair share allocation of network resources, leading to a seamless VM mobility though decreasing degradation of network performance.The focus of this paper is to present the impact of several network architectures and virtualisation on how to reduce the energy consumed by virtual machine migration.

The matrix convolution operation is an inevitable process in a convolutional neural network (CNN) due to its robust approximation to learn and classify the non-linear relationship between the input and output data sets. Today, most of the popular CNNs are stacked with more and more convolution layers (referred to as deep learning) to improve performance, but in many instances, this approach tends to over fit the data, resulting in prediction accuracy loss. The Inception network was an essential milestone in the development of CNN classifiers. The Inception layer is constructed with parallel pipelines of convolution operators, which resulted in improved performance. While several studies have focused on the quantification of the impact of RRAM degradation on the prediction accuracy for pattern classification / image recognition in a simple arbitrary neural network with one or two hidden layers, the impact of these hardware variations on a full-fledged convolutional neural network (CNN) that is commercially used is not well explored. In this study, we extract the GPU trained weights of the CNN platform for visual recognition and replace the GPU weights with the RRAM resistance data in the floating-point format for the Inception network layers alone to quantify the impact of “partial” hardware-based CNN prediction accuracy.","1946-1550","978-1-7281-6169-3","10.1109/IPFA49335.2020.9260780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9260780","Convolution Neural Network (CNN);Resistive Switching Memory;Graphical Processing Unit (GPU);CNN Trained Weights","Resistance;Convolution;Table lookup;Graphics processing units;Hardware;Predictive models;Computational modeling","CMOS memory circuits;convolutional neural nets;elemental semiconductors;floating point arithmetic;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;performance evaluation;pipeline processing;power aware computing;resistive RAM;silicon","matrix convolution operation;convolutional neural network;output data sets;convolution layers;prediction accuracy loss;convolution operators;RRAM resistance data;inception network layers;partial hardware-based CNN prediction accuracy;RRAM variability;inception simulation framework;resistive random access memory;hardware-based neural networks;future edge computing applications;Si CMOS process;power consumption;high integration density;power estimation;robust approximation;CNN classifiers;parallel pipelines;performance improvement;pattern classification;image recognition;GPU trained weights;visual recognition;floating-point format;Si","","","","10","IEEE","26 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data centers operate continuously throughout the year and consume a large amount of electricity every year. Consequently, they bring a great burden to the power departments and the environment. Optimization of workload scheduling in the data centers can reduce the power consumption of both internet technology system and cooling system. The power consumption model of servers is the basis of workload scheduling, and its accuracy and convenience are very essential to the implementation of scheduling. This paper focused on the linear power consumption model which proved to be simple and of high accuracy. Idle power and max power are two main parameters in the linear model and they can be measured through experiment tests. However, the experiment tests take much time and they can not be conducted on the servers already in use. Therefore, this paper aims to build a prediction model of both idle power and max power using readily accessible hardware parameters. A dataset crawled from the SPECpower website was firstly analyzed. And a random forests regression model was built based on it. The data set showed that idle power and max power had a downward and upward trend respectively. The idle power percentage, however, continued to decrease. The random forests regression model performed well. The mean average percentage error of idle power and max power was 16.7% and 10.3% respectively, which were much better than multiple linear regression model results and empirical equation results.","","978-1-6654-3425-6","10.1109/EI252483.2021.9713656","State Grid Corporation of China Science and Technology Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9713656","server;power consumption model;idle power;max power;random forests","Data centers;Power demand;Power measurement;Forestry;System integration;Predictive models;Mathematical models","computer centres;Internet;power consumption;random forests","linear server power consumption model;data centers;power departments;linear power consumption model;max power;random forests regression model;idle power percentage;linear model;g readily accessible hardware parameters","","","","13","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a power consumption evaluation on the effects of live migration of VMs. Results show that the power overhead of migration is much less in the scenario of employing the strategy of consolidation than the regular deployment without using consolidation.

For this technique, if self-management of virtual machines (VMs) can be developed, operational costs will be greatly reduced. To develop self-managed virtualization, it is necessary to develop an algorithm that optimally places VMs on physical machines (PMs) and executes VM migrations among PMs in response to changes in demand. The algorithm must satisfy various requirements, i.e., Minimum power consumption, sufficiently good performance, relatively few migrations, and quick computation. This study proposes three different algorithms for executing VM migrations in order to save electrical power. The proposed methods are based on a greedy algorithm and employ different ways of searching for PMs and VMs involved in migrations. The methods employ an efficiency metric defined in terms of resource usage and electric power for an environment in which power consumption is heterogeneous among PMs. The proposed methods are evaluated via computer simulations. Among these methods, we find there is a trade off between power consumption and the number of migrations. We also find that the most power conserving method achieves power consumption that is close to the strict minimum power.","","978-1-4799-7646-1","10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307006","virtualization;cloud computing;heuristic;greedy algorithm;server management","Power demand;Measurement;Conferences;Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Virtualization","cloud computing;cost reduction;greedy algorithms;power aware computing;virtual machines;virtualisation","virtual machine migration methods;heterogeneous power consumption;self-managed virtualization development;cloud computing;virtual machine self-management;operational costs reduction;VM migration execution;physical machines;minimum power consumption;quick computation;electrical power saving;greedy algorithm;efficiency metric;resource usage;electric power;computer simulations;power consumption","","","","12","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This in essence would also result in higher operational costs for running edge applications. Furthermore, service providers try to manage their resources efficiently to provide appropriate quality of services to their customers while reducing service costs. To appropriately manage resources, it is necessary to apply useful models to measure energy consumption in the edge network. The linear relationship between energy consumption and CPU utilization is one powerful modeling method used to compute the energy consumption of edge network servers. The method calculates the power consumption of a server based on its CPU utilization during run-time. In this paper, we propose a linear power model for the EdgeCloudSim simulator to measure the energy consumption of edge network servers. Moreover, we introduce a simple dynamic power management model used to minimize power consumption in the edge network by switching the edge servers on and off based on provisioned application needs. The experimental and simulation results show a notable reduction in the total energy consumption when applying the proposed simple model on two different orchestration policies to manage the edge network servers.","","978-1-7281-1796-6","10.1109/FMEC.2019.8795328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8795328","Power management;Linear power model;Energy efficiency;Edge computing networks","","computer centres;computer networks;energy conservation;network servers;power aware computing;power consumption;quality of service;resource allocation","power management approach;edge computing servers;linear power model;energy consumption reduction;edge network energy consumption;operational costs;quality of services;service cost reduction;resource management;CPU utilization;EdgeCloudSim simulator;energy efficiency","","12","","26","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Poor energy performance can harm adoption and sales of applications. Unfortunately for the developers, the measurement of software energy con-sumption is expensive in terms of hardware and difficult in terms of expertise. Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software runningwithin emulators or virtual machines. Some prior modelsrequire actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application.In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications. This model leverages a big-data approach whereby a collection of prior applications' energy measurements allows us to train, trans-mit, and apply the model to estimate any foreign application's energy consumption for a test run.

In this context, this paper focus on energetic modeling of servers in data centers. In the state of art, the IT load is usually presented as a whole unit by means of the percentage CPU, while in this work, the percentage CPU is separated in two parts. The first one is the percentage CPU due to server self applications (for example a virtual machine manager), while the second part is due to services turning on the server. This classification led to a new linear model which shows that electricity consumption of data centers can be modeled as accumulated layers depending on what kind of software is running on the servers. The model is developed and then validated with experimental measurements on actual server conduct with the help of industrial partners. This modeling presents the first step of further works aim to optimize the energy consumption of data centers by knowing the IT load that is held on its servers.","","978-1-4673-0342-2","10.1109/ICIT.2012.6209940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209940","modeling;data center;energy consumption;virtual machine;CPU usage;energy efficiency;…","Energy measurement;Virtual machine monitors","computer centres;computer power supplies;energy consumption","model energy consumption;servers;data centers;IT industry;energy management;percentage CPU;electricity consumption;software","","24","","23","IEEE","4 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our aim is to minimize the product of energy consumption and time delay with the constraints of TS ratio and EH requirements. To determine the optimal solution of the original non-convex problem, we decouple it into three subproblems based on the time delay assumption and then solve these subproblems through our proposed constraints activation algorithm.

The AI based smart predictor mainly depends on the huge historical data analytics along with a set of modelling algorithms to specify each logical part. In this paper we have discussed about the core data analytics and the manual evaluation to capture the exact patterns from a real time versatile building energy consumption dataset which could be utilized in the implementation of an AI based smart predictor. With high dimensional data visualization and data analytics we were able to attain relatively lower mean absolute error i.e. a reduction of error up to 40.22% in the data pre-processing phase. We have mainly focused on the handling of the real time energy consumption data set and to trace out the energy supply or consumption breakdown conditions. From a publicly available data set, various data pre-processing criteria have taken and prepared the data-frame for the multivariate prediction model. After data pre-processing linear regression has been used to predict the energy consumption per carpet area and the prediction efficiency has been compared for each cases. With the manual evaluation and the tracing of energy breakdown or any other unusual condition, the prediction performance increased up to 31.03%.","","978-1-7281-7274-3","10.1109/CISPSSE49931.2020.9212200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212200","Data analytics;Artificial Intelligence;Energy consumption predictor;prediction efficiency;building energy consumption","Energy consumption;Data analysis;Electric breakdown;Data visualization;Manuals;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","artificial intelligence;building management systems;data analysis;data visualisation;energy conservation;energy consumption;load forecasting;power engineering computing;real-time systems;regression analysis","energy breakdown;AI based energy consumption predictor;developed countries;energy consumption forecasting;energy production;data analytics;data visualization;energy supply;real time energy consumption data handling;building energy consumption;smart predictor;data preprocessing linear regression;artificial intelligence","","6","","12","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has become necessary to predict PC in order to improve power management and co-operation between the energy used in a building and the power grid. State-of-the-art Energy Consumption Prediction (ECP) methods are limited in terms of predicting the energy effectively, due to various challenges such as weather conditions and the dynamic behaviour of occupants. Thus, to overcome the drawbacks of these methods, we present an intelligent hybrid technique that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Multi-layer Bi-directional Long-short Term Memory (M-BDLSTM) method using three steps. When applied to short-term power ECP, this approach helps to provide efficient power management i.e. it can assist the supplier to produce the optimum amount of power. The first step in our proposed method integrates the pre-processing and data organisation mechanisms to refine the data and remove abnormalities. The second step employs a deep learning network, where the sequence of refined data is fed into the CNN via the M-BDLSTM network to learn the sequence pattern effectively. The third step generates the ECP/PC by comparing actual and predicted data series and evaluates the prediction using error metrics. The proposed method achieves better prediction results than existing techniques, thus demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, it achieved the smallest value of the Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for individual household dataset using 10-fold Cross Validation (CV) and a hold-out (CV) method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963045","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019M3F2A1073179); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945363","Artificial intelligence;deep learning;power consumption;CNN;bi-directional LSTM;short-term energy consumption","Energy consumption;Buildings;Power demand;Deep learning;Support vector machines;Power system management","buildings (structures);convolutional neural nets;energy consumption;learning (artificial intelligence);load management;mean square error methods;power consumption;power engineering computing;power grids;recurrent neural nets","energy consumption prediction;intelligent hybrid technique;Convolutional Neural Network;CNN;short-term power ECP;power management;deep learning network;M-BDLSTM network;data series prediction;hold-out method;residential power energy consumption;multilayer bi-directional LSTM networks;Excessive Power Consumption;electricity-dependent machinery;power grid;short-term prediction;mean square error;root mean square error;10-fold Cross Validation;multilayer bidirectional long-short term memory","","68","","59","CCBY","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One such important application is accurate forecasts of energy demands (loads) at individual sites, but load forecasting is still a challenge. Most load forecasting research has used traditional numerical value estimation, which is a regression style prediction; however, energy consumers will not know if the forecasted load is low or high. Level prediction can be performed by performing regression first and then classifying the values into energy levels, or by using a classification model to predict the levels directly. The Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm is shown to have outperformed other machine learning algorithms for level predictions.

This work presents a system which provides information on the power consumption of a residence through energy monitoring and forecasting. The system was deployed in a residential unit with a solar PV array and the electricity consumption was monitored for 28 days using an online cloud-server database. Moreover, different regression techniques and machine learning algorithms, such as linear and polynomial regression, support vector regression (SVR) and Random Forest, were trained and implemented to identify the model that gives the best accuracy in predicting the total electricity consumption of the residence at the end of the month. Results show that the linear and polynomial regressions produced large errors due to the nonlinear trend of the consumption data, which is attributed to the generated energy of the solar PV array. The support vector regression algorithm generated models with low percent errors in predicting the end of the month electricity consumption. Moreover, the random forest regression accurately predicted the next-day electricity consumption at 0.58 % error.

A process performed on a current server is migrated to another server if the server is expected to consume a smaller amount of electric energy to perform the process than the current server in the estimation model. A process takes checkpoints and sends the checkpoints to the home server. If a process is faulty, the home server recreates the process on an operational server and the process is restarted on a state saved at a checkpoint most recently taken on the home server.

Even though we emphasize power saving as much as possible, the performance of servers should be ensured. So far, there have been some discussions about enhancing power conservation. However, with the best of our knowledge, a mathematical model about consumed power and server's performance has not been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we attempted to minimize the energy consumption with performance constraint of web servers. We know, the response time is the focus of the performance in web servers. Therefore, we first find the trade off value of load for each server based on optimized methods. With the trade off load, the performance of users can be satisfied at the same time the power consumption is minimized. Then, using the trade off load value, we propose a novel load allocation method and then discuss the effectiveness of our load allocation method by comparing with other two methods: random load allocation method and average load allocation method.","2157-0426","978-1-4244-4746-6","10.1109/NBiS.2009.101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350201","Power consumption;web server;performance","Energy consumption;Web server;Optimization methods;Power system modeling;Delay;Information systems;Energy efficiency;Earth;Mathematical model;Pollution","energy conservation;Internet;power aware computing;power consumption;resource allocation","power consumption;performance efficiency constraint;Web server clusters;energy efficiency;energy consumption;data centers;Web hosting facilities;power saving;power conservation;mathematical model;Web server performance;load allocation method","","12","","13","IEEE","8 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes that an optimal balance between time delay and energy consumption be achieved by optimizing the transmission power and bandwidth allocation based on user quality of experience (QoE) in a multi-server intelligent edge network. Given the limited computing capability of devices involved in FEL local training, the transmission power is modeled as a quasi-convex uplink power allocation (UPA) problem, and a lower energy consumption bandwidth allocation algorithm is proposed for solution-seeking. The proposed algorithm allocates appropriate power to the device by adapting the computing power and channel state of the device, thereby reducing energy consumption. As the theoretical deduction result suggests that additional bandwidth should be allocated to those devices with weak computing capabilities and poor channel conditions to realize minimal energy consumption within the restraint time. The simulation result indicates that, the maximum gain of the proposed algorithm can be optimized by 31% compared with the baseline.","1976-5541","","10.23919/JCN.2021.000040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684774","Bandwidth optimization;federated edge learning;QoE;uplink power allocation","Servers;Computational modeling;Training;Wireless communication;Uplink;Energy consumption;Task analysis","bandwidth allocation;convex programming;learning (artificial intelligence);power consumption;quality of experience;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication power management;wireless channels","low power consumption wireless resource allocation;user QoE;federated edge learning;machine learning algorithm;global model parameters;uplink data transmission;systematic time delay;data security;optimal balance;transmission power;user quality;multiserver intelligent edge network;computing capability;FEL local training;quasiconvex uplink power allocation problem;lower energy consumption bandwidth allocation algorithm;appropriate power;computing power;channel state;additional bandwidth;weak computing capabilities;minimal energy consumption;restraint time;massive local data;multiserver federated edge learning;UPA","","2","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","KICS","KICS Journals"

In typical data centers, almost half of the IT energy is dedicated to cooling of the IT server racks. Hybrid cooling technology as an approach to minimize the power consumption uses of water or water based fluid to cool a high heat generating component whereas the rest of the components is cooled by air using internal fans. In this paper, our objective is to optimize the flow rate of air cooling loop of such hybrid cooled server to make data center cooling more cost effective and energy efficient. The volume of air supplied is controlled by varying the air flow rate through the internal fans. Also, the number of fans is reduced from five to three to minimize the power consumption. This finding helped us realize the 40% decrease in Fan power for each server. The pressure difference between the cold and hot aisle is created to avoid the backflow of cold air. Parameters like CPU and memory utilization were varied and temperature of different components such as processors, Dual-In-Line-Memory Module (DIMMs) & Platform Controller Hub (PCH) was monitored. When the server is running with 3 fans (approx. 10 CFM) maximum temperatures are found below the critical temperature. Further studies are also carried out through CFD analysis to observe changes in a model in 6SigmaET to increase the cooling efficiency. The study gives an idea of power savings by fan consolidation for energy efficient hybrid servers.","","978-1-5090-2994-5","10.1109/ITHERM.2017.7992574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7992574","Fan consolidation;Hybrid cooled servers;warm water cooling","Fans;Servers;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Power demand;Pulse width modulation","computer centres;energy conservation;fans;power consumption;space cooling","energy consumption;IT server racks;hybrid cooling technology;power consumption;water based fluid;heat generating component;internal fans;air cooling loop;hybrid cooled server;data center cooling;air flow rate;backflow;dual-in-line-memory module;DIMM;platform controller hub;PCH;CFD analysis;6SigmaET;cooling efficiency;power savings;fan consolidation;energy efficient hybrid servers","","1","","17","IEEE","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We devised a distributed self-organized mechanism based on Game Theory for this purpose. In the worst case, our results are only twice as great as the theoretical minimum power consumption. In addition our mechanism could enhance the current centralized ones in two ways. Firstly, it can make decisions with less delay in response to dynamic behavior of usage patterns in cloud computing.

Due to the limitation of battery capacity and data transmission mode of IoT terminals, the business collaboration computing must consider the energy consumption of the terminals. Since delay and energy consumption are the optimization goals of two co-directional changes, it is difficult to find a business collaboration computing mechanism that simultaneously minimizes delay and energy consumption. This paper takes the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection business scenario in the electric power IoT based on edge computing as the representative, and proposes a two-stage business collaboration computing mechanism including resources allocation and task allocation to optimize the business delay and energy consumption of UAV by decoupling the complex correlation between resource allocation and task allocation. A steepest descent resource allocation algorithm is proposed. On the basis of resource allocation, an improved multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition by dynamically adjusting the size of neighborhood and the cross distribution index is proposed as a task allocation algorithm to minimize energy consumption and business delay. Simulation results show that our algorithms can respectively reduce the business delay and energy consumption by more than 6.4% and 9.5% compared with other algorithms.","2075-5597","","10.23919/cje.2021.00.312","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071070); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10038795","Business collaboration computing;Task allocation;Resource allocation;Electric power IoT","Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Collaboration;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Delays;Power systems;Resource management","autonomous aerial vehicles;edge computing;energy consumption;evolutionary computation;Internet of Things;optimisation;power engineering computing;resource allocation;smart power grids","business delay;data transmission mode;edge computing;electric power IoT;energy consumption;improved multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;Internet of things technology;IoT terminals;steepest descent resource allocation algorithm;task allocation algorithm;two-stage business collaboration computing mechanism;UAV;unmanned aerial vehicle inspection business scenario","","","","32","","7 Feb 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

Thus, predicting the energy consumption of clients is becoming an important part of every energy management system. Energy usage information collected by the clients' smart homes can be used to train a deep neural network to predict the future energy demand. Collecting data from a large number of distributed clients for centralized model training is expensive in terms of communication resources. To take advantage of distributed data in edge systems, centralized training can be replaced by federated learning where each client only needs to upload model updates produced by training on its local data. These model updates are aggregated into a single global model by the server. But since different clients can have different attributes, model updates can have diverse weights and as a result, it can take a long time for the aggregated global model to converge. To speed up the convergence process, we can apply clustering to group clients based on their properties and aggregate model updates from the same cluster together to produce a cluster specific global model. In this paper, we propose a recurrent neural network based energy demand predictor, trained with federated learning on clustered clients to take advantage of distributed data and speed up the convergence process.","2375-9356","978-1-7281-8924-6","10.1109/BigComp51126.2021.00039","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9373194","energy;federated learning;recurrent neural network;clustering;long short-term memory","Training;Computational modeling;Distributed databases;Collaborative work;Data models;Servers;Convergence","client-server systems;energy conservation;energy consumption;energy management systems;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;power engineering computing;recurrent neural nets","federated learning;energy demand prediction;clustered aggregation;negative environmental impacts;power stations;energy grids;power production;energy management system;energy usage information;deep neural network;distributed clients;centralized model training;communication resources;distributed data;edge systems;centralized training;single global model;aggregated global model;convergence process;group clients;aggregate model updates;cluster specific global model;recurrent neural network;energy demand predictor;clustered clients","","12","","19","IEEE","10 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The importance of this analysis comes from many reasons, one of them is that it leads to a better understanding of the system components. This paper presents a clustering algorithm for residential energy consumption using the K-Means algorithm in two different approaches. The dataset utilized in this article contains energy consumption features selected from 25 houses over a period of two years. Firstly, data cleaning has been used to remove and eliminate the inconsistent data, secondly the Elbow method has been applied to determine the optimal number of clusters before using the K-means approach for the purpose of clustering. In K-means, the data have been clustered into two different approaches. The first one is clustering the daily mean consumption in each season in each year. The second one is clustering the monthly mean consumption over the two years. Finally, data visualization has been applied in order to present the result of our proposed method. The paper finds that the households have different consumption behaviors in different seasons, days, and months and that it is due to the change of the average temperature in each season as well as the different appliances and consumptive patters of each house. The results are representative and match the aim of the paper. Further, they are significant for the further development of the energy system and efficient for tracking the consumption of the houses.

Currently, the cost of powering a server is approaching the cost of the server hardware itself, and, in a near future, the former will continue to increase, while the latter will go down. In this context, virtualization is used to decrease the number of servers, and increase the efficiency of the remaining ones. If virtualization can be used to positively impact on the data center energy consumption, this new abstraction layer disconnects user services (hosted on a virtual machine) from their operating cost. In this paper, we propose an approach and a model to estimate the total power consumption of a virtual machine, by taking into account its static (e.g. memory) and dynamic (e.g. CPU) consumption of resources. This model permits to reconnect each VM to its corresponding operating cost, and provides more information to virtual infrastructure providers and users to optimize their infrastructure/applications. It can be observed from results of experiments that the proposed method outperforms the methods found in the literature that only consider the dynamic consumption of resources.","","978-0-7695-5046-6","10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682077","Cloud Computing;Data Center;Energy Metering;Power Modeling and Prediction;Virtualization;Scheduling","Power demand;Servers;Virtual machining;Data models;Computational modeling;Dynamic scheduling;Random access memory","cloud computing;energy consumption;virtual machines","power consumption;idle virtual machine;power management;data center infrastructure;virtualization;data center energy consumption;abstraction layer;static consumption;dynamic consumption","","13","","30","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the higher operating temperature may impact the CPU power consumption due to the leakage current. Moreover, it may degrade the computational performance due to the DVFS mechanism activated to maintain the power and temperature within the TDP limit. In that sense, to fairly evaluate the efficiency of the hot water cooling technique, it becomes important to take into consideration not only the energy reduction on the HPC facility side (cooling system) but also the impact on the power consumption and the performance degradation on the HPC system side. In this paper, we utilized the Oakforest-PACS system and its facility, jointly administrated by University of Tsukuba and The University of Tokyo, in order to execute a quantitative and systematic analysis on the impact of the cooling water temperature onto the HPC system and its facility. For this purpose, we utilized lower (9 °C) and higher (18 °C) cooling water temperature other than the regular operational temperature (12 °C). Contrary to the gain in the energy consumption, on the HPC facility side, when using higher cooling water temperature, we observed an increase in the number of nodes suffering from performance degradation on the HPC system side. As a result, it can directly increase the probability of including low-performance nodes on multiple node jobs, and thus affecting their overall performance, especially during barrier synchronizations.","2168-9253","978-1-7281-6677-3","10.1109/CLUSTER49012.2020.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229622","HPC facility;supercomputer;water cooling;performance evaluation;energy consumption","Temperature sensors;Degradation;Energy consumption;Power demand;Systematics;Cooling;Standards","computer centres;cooling;energy conservation;leakage currents;power aware computing;power consumption","energy consumption;hot water cooling technique;energy efficiency;CPU power consumption;computational performance;energy reduction;HPC facility;performance degradation;HPC system;Oakforest-PACS system;regular operational temperature;higher cooling water temperature;low-performance nodes;operating temperature;leakage current;DVFS mechanism;TDP limit;systematic analysis;multiple node jobs;cooling water temperature impact analysis;temperature 9.0 degC;temperature 18.0 degC;temperature 12.0 degC","","3","","20","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In road networks, the problem of proximity detection refers to detecting whether two moving objects are close to each other or not in real time. However, the battery life and computing capability of mobile devices are limited in the actual scene, which results in high latency and energy consumption. Therefore, it is a tough problem to determine the proximity relationship between mobile users with low latency and energy consumption. In this article, we aim at finding a tradeoff between latency and energy consumption. We formalize the computation offloading problem base on mobile edge computing (MEC) into a constrained multiobjective optimization problem (CMOP) and utilize NSGA-II to solve it. The simulation results demonstrate that NSGA-II can find the Pareto set, which reduces the latency and energy consumption effectively.

An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the sum weighted energy consumption of all devices for HAP-Satellites edge computing. This is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem that is difficult to solve. So, we propose an intelligent heuristic algorithm to optimize task offloading and resource allocation.

The majority of existing scheduling algorithms focus on the completion time as well as cost of a particular workflow application while working within cost limitations; These algorithms, however, fail to account for energy savings. The critical task remapping and frequency scaling RMRECFS (Re-Mapping based Reducing Energy Consumption with Frequency Scaling) method is used in this work to provide an approach for reducing energy consumption. Energy utilization reduction and key task remap are two steps of this technique. The cost budget, critical work path, and expandable budget factor are all included to determine the adjustable cost budget and additional costs in the first stage. To execute a preliminary task and task mapping virtual machines when adhering to configurable budget restrictions, most workflow tasks are then distributed to VMs that spend some least amount of power. By reallocating key jobs and applying frequency scaling to virtual machines based on spare costs, the second phase minimizes power consumption owing to task relocation. Experiment with two different types of workflow applications at various ranges show that the provided RMRECFS algorithm efficiently saves energy usage while staying within budget limitations when compared to the conventional RMREC algorithm","","978-1-6654-9707-7","10.1109/ICIRCA54612.2022.9985689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9985689","Heterogeneous Cloud Computing;Re-Mapping based Reducing Energy Consumption with Frequency Scaling Algorithm;Energy Consumption;Cost Confinement;Virtual Machines","Energy consumption;Cloud computing;Data centers;Costs;Power demand;Scheduling algorithms;Frequency conversion","cloud computing;computer centres;energy conservation;power aware computing;power consumption;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines;workflow management software","budget limitations;cloud data centers;configurable budget restrictions;cost budget;cost confinement;cost limitations;critical work path;energy savings;energy usage;energy utilization reduction;expandable budget factor;heterogenous cloud computing;key job reallocation;key task remap;large-scale workflow applications;pay-per-use mode;power consumption;priority-limited cost-cutting workflows;re-mapping based reducing energy consumption with frequency scaling;RMRECFS workflow;scheduling algorithms;spare costs;task relocation;task remapping;virtual machines;workflow tasks","","","","22","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed model optimizes energy consumption both on system level and component level. On system level, a new virtual machine deployment algorithm based on grouping genetic algorithm is proposed to minimize systems' idle energy consumption, which abstracts the mapping between virtual machines and servers into a multidimensional variable packing problem. On component level, dynamic voltage power adjustment technology is used to reduce energy consumption on execution. Therefore, energy consumption can be reduced on both levels with premise of meeting users' requirements. Experimental results show that compared with other algorithms, the proposed one can greatly reduce the total energy consumption of cloud computing systems under the same conditions.","","978-1-4799-7434-4","10.1109/CIS.2014.171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7016842","cloud computing;real-time task;energy consumption optimization;virtual machine deployment","Virtual machining;Energy consumption;Servers;Cloud computing;Vectors;Optimization;Genetic algorithms","cloud computing;customer services;energy consumption;genetic algorithms;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","genetic algorithm;customer service level;resource allocation;scheduling architecture;energy consumption optimization model;service level agreement;SLA;component level;system level;virtual machine deployment algorithm;multidimensional variable packing problem;dynamic voltage power adjustment technology;cloud computing systems","","","","8","IEEE","22 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under the demands of cloud computing, datacenters struggle to reduce energy consumption through virtualization and datacenter-infrastructure-management systems. Efficient software energy consumption is increasingly becoming an important nonfunctional requirement for programmers. However, are programmers knowledgeable enough about software energy consumption? Do they base their implementation decision on popular beliefs? Researchers surveyed more than 100 programmers regarding their knowledge of software energy consumption. They found that the programmers had limited knowledge of energy efficiency, lacked knowledge of the best practices to reduce software energy consumption, and were often unsure about how software consumes energy.

This is because in current networks, the controlling and data forwarding functions are embedded in the same devices, and all L2/L3 network protocols are designed to work in a distributed manner. Therefore, network devices must be switched on all the time to handle the traffic. This consequently results in very high global energy consumption of communication networks. Software Defined Networking was recently introduced as a new networking paradigm, in which the control plane is physically separated from the forwarding plane and moved to a globally-aware software controller. As a consequence, traffic can be monitored in real time and rerouted very fast regarding certain objectives such as load balancing or QoS enhancement. Accordingly, it opens new opportunities to improve the overall network performance in general and the energy efficiency in particular. This paper proposes an approach that reconfigures the network in order to reduce the energy consumption, based on the current traffic load. Our main idea is to switch on a minimum amount of necessary switches/routers and links to carry the traffic. We first formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem and further present a heuristic method, so called Strategic Greedy Heuristic, with four different strategies, to solve the problem for large networks. We have carried out extensive simulations for a typical campus network and arbitrary mesh networks with realistic traffic information and energy consumption, to prove the potential energy saving of the proposed approach. The results showed that we can save up to 45% of the energy consumption at nighttime.","","978-1-4799-2730-2","10.1109/CloudNet.2014.6968985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968985","Software Defined Networks;Energy Efficiency;Green ICT;Efficient Routing;Campus;Mesh;Network","Energy consumption;Mesh networks;Optical switches;Heuristic algorithms;Communication networks;Routing;Optimization","computer networks;energy conservation;energy consumption;greedy algorithms;integer programming;linear programming;power aware computing;telecommunication traffic","energy consumption optimization;software defined networks;dynamic traffic;energy consumption reduction;mixed integer linear programming;MILP problem;heuristic method;strategic greedy heuristic;campus network;mesh networks;energy saving","","28","","17","IEEE","1 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Note that optimizing a physical network requires tedious time spent manually debugging hardware, by manipulating a virtual network one may add and remove hosts with the click of a mouse. Mininet virtualization software allows the user to carry out what would normally be tedious processes in the matter of minutes. We also present steps toward converting a typical network set-up into an OpenFlow controlled Software Defined Network (SDN); to reduce the power consumption used by the network.

This phenomenon is mainly attributed to that both data collection and definable control can be more clearly achieved. However, simultaneously, there are some defects in energy balance and energy efficiency in SDWSNs, especially in the case of all nodes with limited energy. Large amounts of data reception will cause the rapid energy consumption in the aspect of energy of the controller, which will quickly lead to network failure. In this paper, to balance energy consumption of network in which energy of all nodes are limited and prolong lifetime of the network, we propose a novel balancing energy consumption algorithm based-on controller handover. In proposed algorithm, BP neural network is applied to support the mechanism of handover. Simulation results show that this algorithm can effectively balance energy consumption and extend lifetime of the network compared with the traditional energy saving algorithms in SDWSNs.","","978-1-5386-8339-2","10.1109/CompComm.2018.8780885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8780885","SDWSN;energy consumption;controller handover;BP neural network","Biological neural networks;Energy consumption;Routing;Symmetric matrices;Handover;Wireless sensor networks","backpropagation;energy consumption;neural nets;software defined networking;wireless sensor networks","SDWSNs;wireless sensor networks space;data collection;definable control;energy balance;energy efficiency;data reception;rapid energy consumption;network failure;controller handover;BP neural network;traditional energy;software-defined wireless sensor network;balancing energy consumption algorithm","","2","","15","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Significant portion of the power consumption is due to the power hungry switching fabric necessary for communication in the datacenter. Additionally, the complex cabling in traditional datacenters pose design and maintenance challenges and increase the energy cost of the cooling infrastructure by obstructing the flow of chilled air. In this work we address these problems of traditional datacenters by designing a server-to-server wireless datacenter network (DCN). We propose design methodologies for the use of 60GHz unlicensed millimeter-wave bands to establish direct communication links between servers in a DCN without the need for a conventional fabric. This will reduce the power consumption of the DCN significantly. We first demonstrate that such a power-efficient wireless DCN can sustain the traffic requirements encountered in small to mid-size real datacenters and provide data rates that are comparable to traditional DCNs. Having established the feasibility of a server-to-server wireless DCN in terms of performance, we estimate that its power consumption is lower by four to six times in comparison to a conventional DCN fabric.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254209","","Wireless communication;Servers;Ad hoc networks;Protocols;Power demand;Phased arrays","computer centres;computer networks;cooling;millimetre wave communication;power aware computing;power consumption","power consumption;datacenter networks;server-to-server links;power hungry switching fabric;server-to-server wireless datacenter network;direct communication links;power-efficient wireless DCN;server-to-server wireless DCN;frequency 60.0 GHz","","4","","31","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a unsupervised machine learning model, which contains multiple GMM clusters. These clusters can be used to co-relate power consumption with resource features at different usage levels. In this paper we further adapt GMM for power estimation in a distributed computing cluster. We use basic OS-reported resource features (CPU utilization, memory utilization etc.) of a server in our GMM, and this makes operators easily monitor and control the state of the server once scheduling decision is made. In addition, our GMM uses conditional probability to obtain fine-grained regression. We train the model using full features, which has the higher accuracy comparing with that only using CPU or part of features. In the end, we evaluate the power models in terms of not only accuracy but also usability.

According to this purpose, an algorithm based on artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) has been proposed to detect over utilized hosts and then migrate one or more VMs from them to reduce their utilization; following that we detect underutilized hosts and, if it is possible, migrate all VMs which have been allocated to these hosts and then switch them to the sleep mode. However, there is a trade-off between energy consumption and providing high quality of service to the customers. Consequently, we consider SLA Violation as a metric to qualify the QOS that require to satisfy the customers. The results show that the proposed method can achieve greater power consumption saving than other methods like LR-MMT (local regression-Minimal migration time), DVFS (Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling), IQR-MMT (Interquartile Range-MMT), MAD-MMT (Median Absolute Deviation) and non-power aware.","","978-1-4799-0192-0","10.1109/IC3.2013.6612165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6612165","Cloud computing;Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC);load balancing","Load management;Measurement;Energy consumption;Cloud computing;Power demand;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service","cloud computing;optimisation;power aware computing;power consumption;quality of experience;quality of service;resource allocation;virtual machines","Bee-MMT;load balancing method;power consumption management;cloud computing;energy consumption management;power aware load balancing;artificial bee colony algorithm-minimal migration time;CO2 production;operational cost;ABC algorithm;virtual machine;SLA violation;QoS;customer satisfaction;power consumption saving;LR-MMT;local regression-minimal migration time;DVFS;dynamic voltage frequency scaling;IQR-MMT;interquartile range-MMT;MAD-MMT;median absolute deviation","","26","","12","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, we study approximate arithmetics and a clock-gate based technique called memoization. Moreover, we compare the accuracy of estimation techniques for power consumption evaluation versus real measurements under controlled environments. We also experimentally quantify the relationship between switching activity and power consumption. Two important results are concluded from our investigations: (1) Approximate arithmetics do not necessarily consume less power than conventional circuits, whereas memoization techniques can, in fact, reduce power consumption. (2) Simulation-based power evaluation for approximate FPGA implementations can reach fidelity values up to about 89% in input-dependent power characteristics.

Edge computing is an emerging paradigm that settles some servers on the near-user side and allows some realtime requests from users to be directly returned to the user after being processed by these servers settled on the near-user side. At present, the industry has two major problems for edge computing. One is to reduce the delay for the tasks. The other one is to consider the endurance of power consumption. In this paper, we focus on saving the power consumption of the system to provide an efficient scheduling strategy in mobile edge computing. Our objective is to reduce the power consumption for the providers of the edge nodes while meeting the resources and delay constraints. We first approach the problem by virtualizing the edge nodes into master and slave nodes based on the sleep power consumption mode. After that, we propose a scheduling strategy through balancing the resources of virtual nodes that reducing the power consumption and guarantees the user's delay as well. We use iFogSim to simulate our strategy. The simulation results show that our strategy can effectively reduce the power consumption of the edge system.

Numerical evaluations show that the DCN has a small advantage when the traffic has no locality.

However, these studies, in the majority of cases, takes into account only the CPU and neglects all others components. Whereas, the trend towards high-density packaging and raised memory involve a great increased of power consumption caused by memory and maybe memory can become the largest power consumer in servers.

In addition to reducing system utilization and power consumption the batch service can also maintain an adjustable system performance. When few events are accumulated in the queue of the batch service, a longer waiting time is needed to reach the threshold value for starting the batch service. Therefore we add a time counter to use in conjunction with the batch service in addition to an event counter; this time counter effectively reduces the mean system response time. But now the clock rate of developed server systems is becoming faster. Adopting the batch service is regarded as the system mechanism for processing events, but it may affect a system's performance and power consumption. We use the queueing model method to analyze the system state and to learn the variations among power consumption, system utilization and mean response time by adjusting the size of the batch service.

Moreover, most maintenance systems still use the centralized single processing mode of traditional cloud computing, which increases the data center computing pressure and slows the data flow. To overcome these problems, we propose a communication network edge maintenance system based on smart wearable technology and introduce computation offloading technology for mobile edge computing (MEC). Before offloading, we propose a multimerged computing sorting segmentation (MCSS) algorithm to divide a part of the task to offload. When making an offloading decision, we access a suitable MEC service node for each user with the lowest transmission cost and establish a related model. We use an improved Kuhn-Munkras (KM) algorithm that considers fairness among users to solve this model. After that, we propose a dynamic energy-efficiency awareness strategy. When tasks are processed locally, we optimize the CPU clock frequency. When tasks are offloaded, we adaptively allocate the transmission power. Finally, we conduct a simulation experiment.

In this paper, we consider the problem of energy consumption in data communication, computation and caching (C3) with a quality-of-information (QoI) guarantee in a communication network. Our goal is to identify the optimal data compression rates and cache placement over the network that minimizes the overall energy consumption in the network. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with nonconvex functions, which is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) in general. We propose a variant of the spatial branch-and-bound algorithm (V-SBB) that can provide an $\epsilon$-global optimal solution to the problem. By extensive numerical experiments, we show that the C3 optimization framework improves the energy efficiency by up to 88% compared to any optimization that only considers either communication and caching or communication and computation. Furthermore, the V-SBB technique provides comparatively better solutions than some other MINLP solvers at the cost of additional computation time.","2325-5870","","10.1109/TCNS.2019.2913563","Army Research Laboratory; Ministry of Defence(grant numbers:W911NF-16-3-0001); EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in High Performance Embedded and Distributed Systems(grant numbers:EP/L016796/1); Imperial College London; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8700288","Data compression;energy efficiency;wireless sensor networks","Wireless sensor networks;Energy consumption;Data compression;Sensors;Data aggregation;Data communication;Optimization","cache storage;computational complexity;concave programming;data communication;data compression;energy conservation;energy consumption;integer programming;nonlinear programming;power aware computing;tree searching","nondeterministic polynomial-time hard;C3 optimization framework;energy efficiency;optimal energy consumption;quality guarantee;data-communication systems;system energy consumption;computation costs;data caching costs;cache networks;quality-of-information;communication network;optimal data compression rates;cache placement;mixed integer nonlinear programming problem;nonconvex functions;spatial branch-and-bound algorithm","","4","","31","IEEE","26 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The decentralized architecture of MEC with independent and non-collaborative servers results in the situation of having underutilized servers with wasted energy. Moreover, the consequences of having highly utilized servers with highly consumed energy are not only the incapability to accommodate all the load of the computing jobs and the dramatic increase in the total OPEX cost, but it also creates some environmental problems. Orchestrating servers’ workload and control offloading the computation jobs is one of the technical advantages of MEC since it satisfies the increasing requirements of modern mobile applications while optimizing the energy consumption and cost.

However, the computation resource of each MEC server is limited which may lead to a worse offloading experience of dense edge users. Besides, the communication and computation resources are usually unevenly distributed among different MEC servers which affect the computational efficiency of the MEC network. In this paper, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted MEC system with two near-far edge servers performing cooperative communication, i.e., the edge user employs NOMA to offload partial computation workloads to a nearer MEC server and a farther MEC server, then the nearer server decodes and forwards the farther server's task data by full-duplex relaying mode. Based on the above system model, we formulate an optimization problem of the total system energy consumption minimization by jointly optimizing the local CPU frequency, the power allocation for the user and nearer MEC server, the system time assignment and the task partition. Due to the optimization problem is non-convex, a joint communication and computation resource iterative optimization (JCCRIO) algorithm based on approximation and alternation is designed. Firstly, the local CPU frequency is optimized so as to transform the original problem into a simplified equivalent form. In this way, then the simplified minimization problem can be solved iteratively in two steps. Finally, we obtain the closed-form solutions to the optimization variables at each step. Numerical results show that the proposed NOMA-assisted cooperative MEC scheme is more effective against the terms of energy consumption reduction than comparable schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010571","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971190); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971190); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019MS089,2017MS159); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4164101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144588","Mobile edge computing;NOMA;server cooperation;full-duplex;joint computation and communication resources optimization","Servers;NOMA;Task analysis;Energy consumption;Optimization;Delays;Resource management","cellular radio;energy conservation;energy consumption;iterative methods;minimisation;mobile computing;multi-access systems;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation","server cooperation;NOMA-assisted mobile edge computing system;key communication technique;mobile users;computation tasks;edge servers;worse offloading experience;dense edge users;MEC servers;computational efficiency;MEC network;nonorthogonal multiple access assisted MEC system;edge user;partial computation workloads;system model;total system energy consumption minimization;local CPU frequency;system time assignment;joint communication;computation resource iterative optimization algorithm;simplified minimization problem;MEC scheme;energy consumption reduction","","4","","42","CCBY","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the traditional electric thermal storage heater cannot make use of the relationship between the thermal storage time and the thermal demand of each user, which may cause energy waste when the thermal energy stored exceeds the user's demand or thermal energy shortage caused by insufficient reserve. Aiming to solve the problems, this paper presents a method for thermal energy usage prediction based on recurrent neural networks. Considering the continuous variability of environmental data, we use Bi-directional LSTM to achieve more accurate prediction results by combining the correlation between past information and future information. In addition, aiming at the problem of weight distribution, the attention mechanism is used the prediction algorithm and achieve the goal of rationally assigning weight parameters which can effectively reduce the error rate after the model is updated.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based prediction method of the energy bills for individual households, considering the weather. First, we proposed a gated recurrent unit-based model that can incorporate weather and date information and predict energy usage of electricity, water, and gas. Then, a weighted mean squared error is adopted for training of the proposed model for better accuracy. Finally, the predicted energy usage using the proposed model are converted to a monthly energy bill. The proposed approach is verified on the dataset consisting of energy usage data of 2,234 households and weather data of the Korea Meteorological Administration.

Furthermore, the current reality of manufacturing companies, brought by Industry 4.0 concepts, requires more flexibility of production systems, thus, increasing complexity for machine rescheduling without compromising sustainable requirements. In this paper, we propose a method to predict total energy consumption in job shop systems applying machine learning techniques. Different schedules may result in different consumption rates.

Meanwhile, it is improved by DL (deep learning) algorithm to construct an improved AlexNet algorithm framework.

With technological advances, although the number of transistors on a chip are increasing, the chip area is reducing thereby making power constraints a critical component of system design. In this paper, a scheme for efficient instruction level power profiling of an embedded processor is developed which incorporates a novel methodology to accurately determine the activity generated in the instruction stages of a pipelined processor. An accurate power model has been developed by using the associated net capacitances obtained from gate fanout values and the FPGA resource on which the respective nets are mapped. An open source LEON3 VHDL core has been employed at RTL level. An activity extraction tool has been developed that produces the activity count of each instruction from value change dump file produced by the simulator. To complement the power model, a capacitance extraction tool is also developed which takes mapping and routing information and gives the cumulative capacitance of each net. The activity count and associated capacitance of the nets provides a figure of merit for the power consumed by that instruction. Complete instruction set of LEON3 processor has been profiled in terms of power consumption. The corresponding power for any application is thus obtained instantaneously and consequently avoids low level power estimation overheads. Moreover, the effect as well as the dependence of instruction parameters such as operands and addresses on energy consumption has also been studied.","","978-1-4244-4165-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5224149","Embedded Processors;Instruction Set;Power Profiling;Switching Activity","Embedded software;Capacitance;Power system modeling;Data mining;Energy consumption;Embedded system;Application software;Transistors;Distributed power generation;Power generation","embedded systems;hardware description languages;hardware-software codesign;instruction sets;microprocessor chips;power aware computing;software tools","rapid software power estimation;embedded pipelined processor;instruction level power model;application specific software;chip transistor;FPGA resource;LEON3 VHDL open source core;activity extraction tool;capacitance extraction tool;LEON3 processor instruction set","","7","","13","","28 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an energy-saving pattern by predicting the periodic sensor data after analyzing the continuous transmission data from IoT nodes (at the server beforehand). Our system consists of an IoT based sensor network and a data processing unit. In the sensor network, two types of sensor data, such as temperature and humidity, are collected from four different nodes and sent to the processing unit (integrated on Raspberry Pi). In the processing unit, we worked with two machine learning models-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), which are applied separately on the data of four nodes to make a prediction of future values. A comparative analysis of two models is done in terms of different evaluation metrics where the accuracy of LSTM outperforms ARIMA.

In the extended power consumption laxity-based (EPCLB) algorithm, a server is selected in a set of servers so as to not only satisfy deadline constraint but also reduce the total power consumption of servers in general types of applications. However, each time a load balancer receives a new request, the load balancer has to collect status of each server and calculate the estimated power consumption to perform the request. The load balancer spends large computation and communication overhead to estimate the power consumption if the number of clients is increased. In addition, since the status of each server might be changed during the estimation process, it is difficult to correctly estimate the power consumption. In this paper, we newly propose a CTRB (computation and transmission rate based) algorithm to select a server in a set of possible servers so that the total power consumption of servers and the overhead of a load balancer can be reduced. We evaluate the CTRB algorithm in terms of the power consumption of servers and the overhead of a load balancer compared with the EPCLB and traditional round-robin (RR) algorithms.","","978-1-61284-709-2","10.1109/CISIS.2011.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5989078","Green IT technology;Digital ecosystems;Power Consumption;CTRB algorithm;Round-robin algorithm","Servers;Power demand;Computational modeling;Degradation;Computers;Central Processing Unit","information systems;power aware computing;resource allocation","total power consumption reduction;information systems;extended power consumption laxity based algorithm;digital ecosystems;load balancer;computation and transmission rate based algorithm;round robin algorithms","","5","","15","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the scientific community is investigating ways to improve energy efficiency.

In this paper, we propose the Greenup, Powerup, and Speedup metrics (GPS-UP) to categorize software implementation and optimization efficiency. The GPSUP metrics transform the performance, power and energy of a program into a point on the GPS-UP software energy efficiency quadrant graph. We present eight categories of possible scenarios of software optimization, with examples on how to obtain them. Four categories are green (save energy), and four are red (waste energy).

Unlike previous proposals, our model comprises the full energy consumption of the computing facilities, including cooling systems, and the energy consumption of network devices linking end users to Cloud resources. Finally, we instantiate our model on different Cloud-related architectures, ranging from fully centralized to completely distributed ones, and compare their energy consumption. The results show that a completely distributed architecture, because of not using intra-data center network and large-size cooling systems, consumes between 14 and 25 percent less energy than fully centralized and partly distributed architectures, respectively.

However, these models are weak in adaptability and generalization ability, not adaptable to the changes and fluctuation of different workload, and demanding on the clear and profound understanding of the inner relationship among related power consumption parameters. Therefore, we propose the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) method to model the power consumption of the servers in datacenters, a kind of end-to-end black box model. We performed a fine-grained and in-depth analysis about the system performance and power consumption characteristics of the CPU, memory, and disk of the server running different types of task loads, and selected a set of performance counters that can fully reflect the status of system power consumption as the input of the model. Then, we establish power consumption models based on BP neural network, Elman neural network, and LSTM neural network, respectively. In order to get a better result, we use data collected from four different types of task loads (i.e., CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, I/O-intensive, and mixed load) to train, validate, and test our target models.

This may cause unacceptable increase of error or over-fitting as the power signatures of cloud servers are usually uncertain. Second, the characteristic of workload dispatched to cloud servers is constantly changing while regression-based models can hardly generalize to a wide range of servers and workload types. As a novel solution, we in this paper propose a server power consumption model based on Elman Neural Network (PCM-ENN), aiming to allow accurate and flexible power estimation. PCM-ENN is an end-to-end black box model capable of learning the temporal relation between samples in a time series of power consumption. We trained and evaluated PCM-ENN on two power sequence datasets collected from heterogeneous hardware and operating systems running quasi-production benchmarks like CloudSuite.

The use of cloud-based services, e.g., infrastructure as a service and software as a service (such as Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce.com), is becoming a standard practice in modern IT frameworks. This paradigm shift in the IT industry indicates that the demand for data-center-based services will continue to increase in the future, with concomitant increases in power consumption. In such a scenario, optimizing the IT resources to improve energy efficiency is a necessity. The first step of such an optimization at the application level is knowing how much energy an application is consuming. One of the main challenges in this domain is developing a software-based energy metering tool that can measure an OS processes' energy consumption. Many existing solutions depend on an external watt-meter or other hardware-based enhancements, these are not practical for real-world use in data centers. To overcome the limitations of existing solutions, we have developed an OS process-level power metering tool that can accurately estimate the energy usage of each OS process running on a Linux server without an online watt-meter. Based on a set of experiments, we demonstrated that our method and implementation provides energy consumption estimation for complex e-business applications with above 95% accuracy.","","978-0-7695-5046-6","10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682054","Energy;Power Meter;Green IT;Measurement;Modeling","Energy consumption;Mathematical model;Energy measurement;Hardware;Software;Biological system modeling;Equations","cloud computing;energy consumption;power meters","software process;power consumption;data center;cloud-based services;infrastructure as a service;software as a service;Google Docs;Microsoft Office 365;Salesforce.com;IT framework;data-center-based services;energy efficiency;software-based energy metering tool;OS process-level power metering tool;energy usage;Linux server;energy consumption estimation","","4","","23","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has enriched the applications of cloud computing, ranging from industry, business, to scientific fields. Nowadays cloud computing has become one of the important research issues in the computing and computer network fields. A cloud computing system consists of several independent servers. By way of the virtualization technique, the system manages all of the computing resources efficiently to process each user demand. However, a great number of operating servers will bring considerable power consumption. Efficient resource allocation methods design is one of the important solution approaches to relieve this situation. A resource allocation method will generally allocate each arriving job to proper available computing resources (the virtual machines, VMs) based on the consideration of the related features (such as the job size, the arrival time, etc.) of jobs in the waiting queue. Although the future arrival jobs are unknown, they will significantly affect the resulting performance of the resource allocation. In this paper, we develop an Energy Conserving Resource Allocation Scheme with Prediction (ECRASP) for cloud computing systems. The prediction mechanism can predict the trend of arriving jobs (dense or sparse) in the near future and their related features, so as with help the system to make adequate decisions. Simulation results show that our proposed ECRASP method performs well compared to conventional resource allocation algorithms in the energy conserving comparisons.","","978-1-4799-5464-3","10.1109/GRC.2014.6982857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982857","Cloud computing;Resource allocation;Exponential smoothing prediction","Resource management;Cloud computing;Load management;Loading;Power demand;Energy consumption;Servers","cloud computing;network servers;power aware computing;resource allocation;virtualisation","prediction based energy conserving resource allocation scheme;computer network fields;cloud computing system;independent servers;virtualization technique;computing resources;energy conserving resource allocation scheme with prediction;ECRASP","","14","","10","IEEE","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One approach to address this is to optimize physical resource allocation for virtualized functions. For this approach, power consumption needs to be estimated, and many papers have proposed models to estimate server power consumption. However, applying such estimation techniques to data center servers presents an operational challenge. Specifically, it is difficult to reduce the cost of model building and data collection while maintaining estimation accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a management system with a modeling function and a data selection function. The modeling function builds accurate models in accordance with application requirements, and the data selection function selects data related to server power consumption and then instructs data collection to each processing server. Our main effort in this paper was to address the monitoring function issue to reduce server power consumption during data collection.

However, evaluating the performance of these AFs using the current building performance simulation (BPS) tools is complex, time-consuming, and computationally intensive. These limitations can be overcome by using a machine learning (ML) model as a method to assess the AF system efficiently during the early design stage. This study presents an alternative approach using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can predict the hourly cooling loads of AF in significantly less time compared to BPS. To construct the model, a generative parametric simulation of office tower spaces with an AF shading system were simulated in terms of energy consumption using Honeybee add-on in Grass-hopper which are linked to EnergyPlus for training the ANN model.

Most of the existing models calculate the fuel consumption based on vehicle kinematics. However, based on recent truck field test data, we found the estimation discrepancies of several models published were considerable since they cannot accurately estimate the vehicle engine operation states and their base energy consumption rates. The engine power estimation is an essential part of the energy consumption model, which is the most likely cause of the model discrepancy. This inspired us to develop a generic modeling approach for vehicle engine-power estimation with a deep learning based on field experimental data. The data collected from a wide range of truck field tests were used for model development and fuel consumption model evaluation. The results show that the deep learning approach enables a much more accurate estimation of HDT engine power, and when applied as the input to the fuel consumption models (e.g., VT-CPFM, MOVES), average fuel estimation error is reduced to 13.71% from 28.9% which is the error resulted from the tractive power method. Besides, once calibrated with a small data set, it could be applied to various traffic scenarios without re-calibration. In addition, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a neural network structure component of the model, can accurately depict the fuel consumption during engine braking, which is largely missing in conventional HDT fuel models. The proposed model can benefit energy consumption related transportation planning and traffic operation studies that require more accurate vehicle fuel consumption estimation without detailed and complicated engine dynamics information.","","978-1-7281-2956-3","10.1109/ENERGYCon48941.2020.9236554","U.S. Department of Energy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9236554","Heavy duty truck;Fuel consumption model;deep learning","Deep learning;Energy consumption;Estimation error;Data models;Fuels;Vehicle dynamics;Engines","energy consumption;fuel economy;internal combustion engines;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;power engineering computing;road vehicles;transportation;vehicle dynamics","deep learning engine power model;heavy-duty trucks;truck energy consumption;energy saving strategies;estimation discrepancies;vehicle engine operation states;base energy consumption rates;engine power estimation;energy consumption model;model discrepancy;generic modeling approach;vehicle engine-power estimation;field experimental data;truck field tests;model development;fuel consumption model evaluation;deep learning;HDT engine power;tractive power method;engine braking;energy consumption related transportation planning;traffic operation studies;accurate vehicle fuel consumption estimation;engine dynamics information;truck field test data;long short-term memory;neural network structure component","","","","22","IEEE","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Central to these approaches is the accurate estimation of the power consumption of the various subsystems of a server, particularly, the processor. We distinguish between power consumption measurement techniques and power consumption estimation models.

Simulation is commonly used for understanding architectural tradeoffs, however many emerging workloads cannot even run on many full-system simulators. Even if you manage to run an emerging workload, it may be a tiny part of the workload, because detailed simulators are prohibitively slow. This talk presents some examples of how machine learning can be used to solve some of the problems haunting the performance evaluation field. An application for machine learning is in cross-platform performance and power prediction. If one model is slow to run real-world benchmarks/workloads, is it possible to predict/estimate its performance/power by using runs on another platform? Are there correlations that can be exploited using machine learning to make cross-platform performance and power predictions? A methodology to perform cross-platform performance/power predictions will be presented in this talk. Another application illustrating the use of machine learning to calibrate analytical power estimation models will be discussed. Yet another application for machine learning has been to create max power stressmarks. Manually developing and tuning so called stressmarks is extremely tedious and time-consuming while requiring an intimate understanding of the processor. In our past research, we created a framework that uses machine learning for the automated generation of stressmarks.

It requires the generator to vary load as per the requirements of the grid which changes rapidly. One of the parameters crucial for power generation is condenser vacuum. The operator needs to keep a constant watch on condenser pressure for safe and reliable generation. At low load, to save Auxiliary Power Consumption (APC) operator takes several steps and makes a trade off with condenser vacuum. In this context, it becomes essential to have a tool which can assimilate changes in the system and predict condenser vacuum. Parameters on which Condenser Vacuum largely depends upon, is the Cooling Water (CW) inlet temperature, CW Outlet Temperature, CW flow to Condenser, Exhaust Hood Temperature and instant power generated by the unit. A guiding tool can be handy for the operator to switch off CW pumps, Cooling Tower (CT) fans and other auxiliaries which affect Condenser Vacuum in order to save APC. An advance prediction tool can also assist the operator to analyze any unwanted changes in the operating parameters of the unit. In this paper we will be using several regression algorithms on sample plant data to train our predictive model and to adjudge the prediction given by each algorithm for condenser vacuum.

Therefore the generation of electrical power is not so easy. Consumption of electrical energy can be classified into two categories viz. residential and commercial. In the case of the residential sector, heavy fluctuation may occur according to the energy usage pattern concerning time. This unusual variation in power patterns may give stress to generating units. Therefore, if we can predict the demand in early stages we could take remedies like increasing/decreasing power generation capacity, inheriting data power and reducing its usage, giving less stress and also will not transfer stress to other appliances. Thus the prediction of electricity consumption is required. During peak and off-peak hours mainly our aim is for approximately predicting the required demand with the help of demand response to match the available energy resources. As a result of this load at the power station would be balanced. From the demand prediction, we try to swap the resources from peak hours (which consume high energy) to off-peak hour (which consume minimal energy).","","978-1-7281-4988-2","10.1109/ICCSP48568.2020.9182214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9182214","Demand;prediction;energy consumption;residential.","Buildings;Power generation;Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Load management;Temperature distribution;Meteorology","demand side management;domestic appliances;energy conservation;learning (artificial intelligence);power consumption;power engineering computing;power generation economics","minimal energy;peak hours;demand prediction;power station;demand response;required demand;off-peak hour;electricity consumption;data power;generating units;power patterns;unusual variation;energy usage pattern;heavy fluctuation;electrical power;electrical energy;demand power prediction;machine learning algorithms","","","","14","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this study is to implement a data-driven method of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict a building’s energy consumption at one of the ministry buildings in Putrajaya. The prediction models were developed based on historical data on the electricity consumption of the building and weather forecasts including temperature, relative humidity and pressure from September 2009 to April 2017. Various configurations were tested based on the ‘trial and error’ method to improve the accuracy of the model. The forecasting model achieved 0.8237% of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and 99.17% of accuracy. The findings of the study will enable the management to model and predict the power usage of the facility using ANN in WEKA. The power usage prediction will help to provide input in understanding the future energy consumption behavior of the facility and will enable the management to assess potential energy efficiency improvements and behavior modification of the building towards achieving higher energy savings.","","978-1-6654-9981-1","10.1109/ICSSA54161.2022.9870959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9870959","energy;efficiency;ANN;WEKA;forecasting","Potential energy;Energy consumption;Temperature distribution;Buildings;Time series analysis;Weather forecasting;Artificial neural networks","building management systems;energy conservation;energy consumption;neural nets;power consumption;power engineering computing;weather forecasting","power usage modelling;artificial neural networks;building sector;data-driven method;ANN;ministry buildings;prediction models;historical data;electricity consumption;weather forecasts;relative humidity;trial and error method;forecasting model;power usage prediction;future energy consumption behavior;potential energy efficiency improvements;energy savings;MAPE;mean absolute percentage error;WEKA","","","","26","IEEE","5 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Improving Multicore Server Performance and Reducing Energy Consumption by Workload Dependent Dynamic Power Management","K.

Typically, the power supply and the core speed are increased when there are more tasks in a server, such that tasks can be processed faster and the average task response time is reduced. On the other hand, the power supply and the core speed are decreased when there are less tasks in a server, such that energy consumption can be reduced without significant performance degradation. A queueing model of multicore server processors with workload dependent dynamic power management is established. Several speed schemes are proposed and it is demonstrated that for the same average power consumption, it is possible to design a multicore server processor with workload dependent dynamic power management, such that its average task response time is shorter than a multicore server processor of constant speed (i.e., without workload dependent dynamic power management). It is shown that given certain application environment and average power consumption, there is an optimal speed scheme that minimizes the average task response time. For two-speed schemes, the problem of optimal design of a two-speed scheme for given power supply and power consumption model is formulated and solved. It is pointed out that power consumption reduction subject to performance constraints can be studied in a similar way as performance improvement (i.e., average task response time reduction) subject to power consumption constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on analytical study of workload dependent dynamic power management.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2440238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118153","Dynamic power management;energy consumption;multicore server processor;queueing model;response time;Dynamic power management;energy consumption;multicore server processor;queueing model;response time","Servers;Multicore processing;Time factors;Power demand;Cloud computing;Energy consumption","energy conservation;multiprocessing systems;network servers;power aware computing;queueing theory","multicore server performance;energy consumption reduction;workload dependent dynamic power management;power supply;core speed;queueing model;power consumption model","","35","","28","IEEE","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The request is performed as a process in the server. In this paper, we consider a computation process which mainly consumes CPU resource. Cooling devices like fans consume the electric power in addition to CPU and other devices in a server. The rotation speed of a fan is changed in servers according to the temperature of a server. Thus, the total power consumption of a server depends on not only computational devices like CPU but also cooling devices. The extended simple power consumption (ESPC) model of a server is proposed to perform processes. In this paper, the ESPC model is improved to consider a server with a multi-core CPU. It is critical to discuss how to select a server for each request from clients in order to not only achieve performance objectives but also reduce the total power consumption of a system based on the ESPC model. The improved power consumption laxity based (IPCLB) algorithm for selecting a server is proposed in this paper, which consumes the minimum power to perform the process.

In order to improve energy efficiency, it is not only necessary to conduct statistics and analysis on energy historical data, but also to predict future energy data. In this paper, Bicubic interpolation algorithm and convolutional neural network are used to spatially predict energy consumption. The model framework structure for energy consumption prediction is given, and the two models are experimentally analyzed. The results show that the convolutional neural network is better than the Bicubic interpolation method, and the prediction result is closer to the actual value. For the high spatial complexity of energy consumption data, the definition and framework of the RessNetGAN model are first given. Secondly, the specific structure of the generator is given. How to extract the spatial eigenvalue of energy consumption through 3D convolution operation is introduced, and the experiment is carried out by changing the pooling parameters of the energy consumption to be predicted.

However, the limited energy allocation mechanism in edge-SD wireless sensor networks (ESDWSNs) makes the energy consumption of different nodes unbalanced. In this paper, we propose an energy allocation optimization (EAO) algorithm that solves the energy averaging and minimization (ECAM) problem in ESDWSNs by selecting appropriate relay nodes and de-duplicated data flows. Specifically, we first establish a novel three-layer network architecture based on the edge computing and software-defined technologies.

Indeed, it represents 157 MW of installed capacity. Like all intermittent power plants, production depends on the environmental parameters of the area where it is located. Bad weather can cause instability in the electricity grid. It is necessary to use methods to forecast its production. This will facilitate the decision making on the amount of energy to be produced to meet the demand. In this sense, this paper aims to predict wind generation by dividing the prediction data into 80% for training our model and 20% for testing the prediction efficiency of the model in order to quantify the energy produced and to allow an optimal transition between intermittent and fossil energy sources. The proposed neural network model was combined with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm while varying the number of hidden layers to evaluate the impact of these layers on the prediction efficiency. The rapid convergence of this algorithm and the increase in hidden layers enhanced the prediction performances. The results obtained show that varying the number of hidden layers increases the performance of neural models applied to intermittent energy prediction. The proposed approach gives its best prediction accuracy of 94.57% for the 100 hidden layer network.","","978-1-6654-5168-0","10.1109/CISTEM55808.2022.10080929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10080929","Prediction;Renewable energy;Neural network;multilayer","Wind energy generation;Decision making;Production;Predictive models;Wind power generation;Prediction algorithms;Data models","decision making;load forecasting;neural nets;power consumption;power engineering computing;power grids;wind power plants","decision making;electricity consumption;electricity grid;environmental parameters;fossil energy sources;Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm;multilayer neural network model;power 157.0 MW;prediction data;SENELEC network;Taiba ndiaye power plant;wind generation;wind power plant","","","","28","IEEE","27 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the route fails, because the single-path protocols need to restart the route discovery process, the delay of the network is greatly increased. Therefore, the multi-path routing protocol is proposed, saving the cost of route discovery. In this paper, we propose an ad hoc on-demand multi-path distance vector (AOMDV) routing protocol based on link lifetime and energy consumption prediction (named LLECP-AOMDV) for mobile edge computing. In the route discovery phase, the energy grading strategy is adopted. When the node energy is lower than the threshold, it no longer participates in the route discovery. In the routing selected phase, the path is selected based on the lifetime of the route link and the minimum energy consumption of the route. According to energy consumption, packet delivery rate, end-to-end delay performance indicators, we evaluate the comparison results. The result shows that under most network performance indicators and parameters, the proposed LLECP-AOMDV is superior to the other three protocols, which improves the network lifetime, reduces the node’s energy consumption and the average end-to-end delay. The protocol is very useful for mobile edge computing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986078","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571328); Tianjin Key Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:18JCZDJC96800); Major Projects of Science and Technology in Tianjin(grant numbers:15ZXDSGX00050); Training Plan of Tianjin University Innovation Team(grant numbers:TD12-5016,TD13-5025,TD2015-23); Major Projects of Science and Technology for their Services in Tianjin(grant numbers:16ZXFWGX00010,17YFZC GX00360); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057666","Mobile edge computing;MANET;AOMDV;energy threshold;link lifetime;energy consumption","Routing protocols;Energy consumption;Edge computing;Routing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Computational modeling","energy consumption;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","multipath routing protocol;link lifetime;energy consumption prediction;mobile edge computing;node energy;link failure;network lifetime;ad-hoc network;single-path protocols;route discovery process;ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector routing protocol;LLECP-AOMDV;route discovery phase;energy grading strategy;routing selected phase;route link;minimum energy consumption;network performance indicators","","69","","61","CCBY","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a simple software methodology that can be adapted by researchers to estimate the energy cost of kernels. Kernels are operations that can be implemented in hardware and are executed frequently in algorithms. This energy estimation helps in exploiting opportunities for energy optimizations in various algorithms. As a case study, we apply our methodology on back propagation (BP) algorithm and we estimate the energy cost of its kernels on two different architectures using: a) Simulation tools for the RISC architecture b) Physical measurement of the current and voltage using special boards for the CISC architecture. Our experiments show that the produced energy costs using our method have 5.14% error with respect to the costs of these kernels in real codes, which proves the high accuracy of our methodology. The results also show that different architectures exhibit different energy consumption when executing the same kernel which proves that alternative kernel implementations have impact on energy saving. Based on the estimated energy costs of the kernels, we further propose an energy optimization technique by using lookup tables (LUT). The proposed technique targets the exponential kernel because of its high energy consumption and replaces it with a LUT. The experimental results show a significant reduction of 99.97% in the energy consumed by the exponential kernel.","2381-0947","978-1-4673-0465-8","10.1109/ICEAC.2011.6136679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6136679","Energy Aware;Back Propagation Algorithm","Kernel;Computer architecture;Optimization;Reduced instruction set computing;Voltage measurement;Current measurement;Accuracy","backpropagation;operating system kernels;optimisation;power aware computing;reduced instruction set computing;software cost estimation;table lookup","mobile devices;software methodology;energy cost estimation;back propagation algorithm;simulation tool;RISC architecture;CISC architecture;energy consumption;energy saving;kernel energy estimation;energy optimization technique;lookup tables;exponential kernel;LUT","","2","","19","IEEE","23 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, cloud service providers are exploring low-cost strategies for reducing energy use and carbon emissions. Therefore, work planning has garnered great attention and critical consideration about effective resources and bad energy consumption.

Machine learning models are the most accurate models used in prediction. The goal of our study is to predict the electricity power consumption every 10 minutes, and/or every hour with the determining objective of which approach is the most successful. To this end, we will compare different types of machine learning models that recently have gained popularity: feedforward neural network with backpropagation algorithm, random forest, decision tree, and support vector machine for regression (SVR) with radial basis function kernel. The parameters associated with the comparative models are optimized based on Grid-search method in order to find the accurate performance. The dataset that is used in this comparative study is related to three different power distribution networks of Tetouan city which is located in north Morocco. The historical data used has been taken from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA) every 10 minutes for the period between 2017-01-01 and 2017- 12-31.

It takes tens of minutes for changes of operational parameters of air conditioners including outlet air temperature and volume to be actually reflected in the temperature distribution in the whole data center. Proactive control of the air conditioners is therefore required according to the predicted temperature distribution, which is highly dependent on the task assignment on the servers. In this paper, we apply a machine learning technique for predicting the temperature distribution in a data center. The temperature predictor employs regression models for describing the temperature distribution as it is predicted to be several minutes in the future, with the model parameters trained using operational data monitored at the target data center. We evaluated the performance of the temperature predictor for an experimental data center, in terms of the accuracy of the regression models and the calculation times for training and prediction. The temperature distribution was predicted with an accuracy of 0.095°C. The calculation times for training and prediction were around 1,000 seconds and 10 seconds, respectively. Furthermore, the power consumption of air conditioners was decreased by roughly 30% through proactive control based on the predicting temperature distribution.","","978-1-4673-9560-1","10.1109/CloudCom.2015.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396226","Data center;Energy management;Machine learning;Temperature pridiction","Temperature distribution;Temperature sensors;Servers;Predictive models;Power demand;Data models;Training","computer centres;learning (artificial intelligence);power consumption;regression analysis;temperature distribution","temperature distribution;data center;power consumption;machine learning;coordinated control;air conditioner;task assignment;proactive control;regression model","","6","","16","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The EC estimation on tasks is critical to task scheduling and source-code improvement in the aspect of EC optimization. The existing studies treat a task as a program, and EC of the task as the simple summation of each statement's EC. However, EC of two tasks consisting of the same statements with different structures is unequal; therefore, the code structure should be highlighted in source-level EC estimation. In this paper, an abstract energy consumption (AEC) model, which is static and runtime-independent, is proposed. For the model, the two quantitative measurements, “cross-degree”and “reuse-degree,”are proposed as the code structure features, and the relationship between EC and the measurements is formulated. Although AEC is not a precise EC measurement, it can properly represent the EC of a task, compare with other tasks, and verify the optimization effect. Experimental results show that the ratios between the EC and AEC with 50 test cases are stable; the standard deviation is 0.0002; and the mean value is 0.005. The regularities of EC and code structures, represented as “cross-degree”and “reuse-degree,”are also validated.

Although, there are many existing energy-aware approaches focusing on minimizing energy consumption while ignoring the SLA violation at the time of a virtual machine (VM) selection from overloaded hosts. Also, they do not consider that the current network traffic causes performance degradation and thus may not really reduce SLA violation under a variety of workloads. In this context, this paper proposes three adaptive models, namely, gradient descent-based regression (Gdr), maximize correlation percentage (MCP), and bandwidth-aware selection policy (Bw), that can significantly minimize energy consumption and SLA violation. Energy-aware methods for overloaded host detection and VM selection from an overloaded host are necessary to improve the energy efficiency and SLA violation of a cloud data center after migrating all VM from underloaded host turn to idle host, which switch to energy-saving mode is also beneficial. Gdr and MCP are adaptive energy-aware algorithms based on the robust regression model, for overloaded host detection. A Bw dynamic VM selection policy selects VM according to the network traffic from the overloaded host under SLAs. Experimental results on the real workload traces show that the proposed algorithms reduce energy consumption while maintaining the required performance levels in a cloud data center using a CloudSim simulator to validate the proposed algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872750","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2016YFB0800801); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672186,61472108); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DPDP170103305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479359","Cloud computing;cloud data center;energy-efficiency;green computing;host overloaded detection;regression method;service level agreements","Cloud computing;Data centers;Heuristic algorithms;Servers;Energy consumption;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling","cloud computing;computer centres;contracts;energy conservation;energy consumption;power aware computing;regression analysis;resource allocation;virtual machines","energy-aware methods;overloaded host detection;energy efficiency;cloud data center;energy-saving mode;adaptive energy-aware algorithms;cloud computing;Bw dynamic VM selection policy;bandwidth-aware selection policy;virtual machine selection;SLA violation;large-scale cloud data centers;high energy consumption","","100","","32","OAPA","2 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In future utilities have to correctly predict the power consumption at in-plant auxiliaries to arrive at the total capacity available for selling and to estimate the operational cost. Auxiliary power consumption is an important index that describes how well a thermal power plant is operating. Induced draft (ID) fan power consumption is almost one-third of the total power consumption by in-house auxiliaries. This paper details the methodology adopted for prediction of ID fan power consumption by artificial neural network. Operational parameters from fifty number of boilers have been collected and used for the analysis. Nine influential parameters that accurately describe the power consumption at ID fan are identified.

Recently, one widely discussed way to do this is the integration of heterogeneous computation devices into the supercomputer systems as these tend to have a far better performance/energy ratio for large classes of applications. The obvious drawback of heterogeneous systems is the additional design complexity for the software development in order to efficiently use these devices in terms of performance as well as power. For this reason we propose a flow, which assists the software developer at design time, offering immediate power- and performance-estimation.

Cloud Radio Access Network (CRAN) is widely adopted in 5G networks, which splits the traditional base stations into Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) and Baseband Units (BBUs), which are equipped with computing resource for baseband signal processing. The number of required BBUs varies due to the fluctuation of wireless traffic of RRHs. Hence, fixed computing resource allocation might waste power. This paper investigates energy-efficient dynamic computing resource allocation in CRAN by predicting the wireless traffic of RRHs and allocating computing resource based on the prediction results aiming at using fewest BBUs to minimize power consumption. For wireless traffic prediction, a novel method based on two-dimensional CNN LSTM model with temporal aggregation is proposed. By treating the wireless traffic data as images, this model could extract spatial correlation from these data to improve accuracy. Moreover, the problem of dynamic computing resource allocation in CRAN is formulated as an offline four-constraint bin packing problem, considering both uplink and downlink baseband signal processing capacities of BBUs and Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) bandwidths. For solving this problem, a Multi-start Simulated Annealing (MSA) algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method for wireless traffic prediction could outperform the state-of-the-art deep learning models. In addition, the proposed MSA algorithm could achieve lower power consumption than the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms.","2644-125X","","10.1109/OJCOMS.2022.3146886","Discovery Program of Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9695980","Computing resource allocation;wireless traffic prediction;CRAN;deep learning;twodimensional CNN LSTM;multi-start simulated annealing","Wireless communication;Predictive models;Baseband;Power demand;Deep learning;Signal processing;Resource management","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);power consumption;radio access networks;resource allocation;simulated annealing;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","traffic prediction-enabled energy-efficient dynamic computing resource allocation;CRAN;baseband signal processing;cloud radio access network;traditional base stations;fixed computing resource allocation;wireless traffic prediction;wireless traffic data;downlink baseband signal;Common Public Radio Interface bandwidths;deep learning models;multistart simulated annealing algorithm;remote radio heads;baseband units","","3","","48","CCBY","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most energy efficiency schemes have little consideration of the subsequent traffic load as well as the impact of energy saving on network performance, which brings many challenges, such as frequent flow rerouting, continual device state transition, and network load imbalance. In this article, we propose an energy efficiency optimization framework based on traffic prediction in software-defined networking, aiming at reducing network energy consumption while ensuring communication quality. First, we design a real-time traffic prediction mechanism based on gated recurrent unit neural network of deep learning to capture the temporal characteristics of network traffic and provide data basis for the deployment of energy-saving strategies. Second, we propose a heuristic algorithm for energy efficiency optimization to balance flow demand and energy consumption and to achieve dynamic load balancing and energy saving.

Distributing load leads to a more energy-efficient usage of the servers within a server farm. Additionally, the use of energy saving modes like suspend to main memory can decrease the energy consumption dramatically. The selection of nodes to be transferred into a low energy mode is based on the information of an energy-efficient load distribution. The usage of low energy modes requires knowledge about future loads. Having a variable load profile, i.e. variations in loads over time, leads to time periods in which servers are idle (denoted as gaps). Within these gaps, servers can be transferred into one of various supported energy saving modes. It is crucial to have information about future gaps in advance to make the right decision in regard to the chosen energy saving mode. Usually, information about the future is not directly available but can be predicted using sophisticated algorithms.

The purpose of this work is to enable CNN accelerator designers to explore how design choices affect the memory subsystem in particular, which is a significant contributing component. By considering high-level design parameters of CNN accelerators that affect the memory subsystem, the proposed tool returns power and energy consumption estimates for a range of networks and memory types. This allows for power and energy of the off-chip memory subsystem to be considered earlier within the design process, enabling greater optimisations at the beginning phases. Towards this, the paper introduces POMMEL, an off-chip memory subsystem modelling tool for CNN accelerators, and its evaluation across a range of accelerators, networks, and memory types is performed.

In a typical hierarchical router cache structure, the upper level storage serves as a cache for the lower level, which forms a distributed multi-level cache system. In the past two decades, several classic LRU-based multi-level cache policies were proposed to improve the overall I/O performance of storage systems. However, few power-aware multi-level cache policies focus on the storage devices in the bottom level, which consume more than 27% energy of the whole system [20]. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Power-Aware Multi-level cache (PAM) policy, which can reduce the energy consumption of storage devices with both high performance and high I/O bandwidth. In our PAM policy, a proper number of cold dirty blocks in the upper level cache are identified and selected to flush directly to the storage devices, which provides high probability to extend the duration time of data disks with standby status. Thus the energy consumption can be reduced. Simulation results show that, compared to the existing popular cache schemes such as PA-LRU, PB-LRU and Demote, PAM saves the power consumption by up to 15% under different I/O workloads, which improves the energy efficiency by up to 50.5%.","","978-1-6319-0022-8","10.4108/icst.iniscom.2015.258322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7157817","Storage System;Multi-level Cache;Energy Consumption;I/O Performance;Hint","Bismuth;Queueing analysis","cache storage;disc storage;energy conservation;network routing;power aware computing;power consumption;software defined networking","power-aware multilevel cache policy;software defined network;energy consumption;Internet operations;multilevel routing;hierarchical router cache structure;upper level storage;distributed multilevel cache system;LRU-based multilevel cache policies;I/O performance;storage systems;storage devices;PAM policy;high I/O bandwidth;cold dirty blocks;data disks;standby status;PA-LRU cache schemes;PB-LRU cache schemes;Demote cache schemes;power consumption;energy efficiency","","1","","36","","16 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Minimum Energy Point Tracking (MEPT) is one of the most efficient methods to reduce both dynamic and static energy consumption of a processor. Previous works proposed a variety of MEPT methods over the past years. However, none of them incorporate their algorithms with practical real-time operating systems, although edge computing applications often require low energy task execution with guaranteeing real-time properties. The difficulty comes from the time complexity for identifying MEP and changing voltages, which often prevents real-time task scheduling. This paper proposes an approximated MEPT algorithm, which reduces the complexity of identifying MEP down to that of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). We also propose a task scheduling algorithm, which adjusts processor performance to the workload, and provides a soft real-time capability to the system. With these two methods, MEPT became a general task, and the operating system stochastically adjusts the average response time of a processor to be equal to a specified deadline. The experiments using a fabricated test chip show that the energy loss induced by the proposed algorithm is only 0.5% at most, and the algorithm does not sacrifice the fundamental real-time properties.","1948-3287","978-1-7281-7641-3","10.1109/ISQED51717.2021.9424343","Mentor Graphics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9424343","Minimum Energy Point Tracking (MEPT);Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS);Adaptive Body Biasing (ABB);Real-Time Operating System (RTOS);Soft Real-Time Scheduling","Energy loss;Energy consumption;Program processors;Scheduling algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Real-time systems","distributed processing;operating systems (computers);power aware computing;real-time systems;scheduling","MEPT algorithm;task scheduling algorithm;processor performance;minimum energy point tracking;soft real-time scheduling;dynamic energy consumption;static energy consumption;real-time operating systems;edge computing","","1","","15","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this domain, most of the state-of-the-art solutions concentrate on coarse-grained approaches to monitor the energy consumption of a device or a process. However, none of the existing solutions addresses in-process energy monitoring to provide in-depth analysis of a process energy consumption. In this paper, we therefore report on a fine-grained runtime energy monitoring framework we developed to help developers to diagnose energy hotspots with a better accuracy than the state-of-the-art. Concretely, our approach adopts a 2-layer architecture including OS-level and process-level energy monitoring. OS-level energy monitoring estimates the energy consumption of processes according to different hardware devices (CPU, network card). Process-level energy monitoring focuses on Java-based applications and builds on OS-level energy monitoring to provide an estimation of energy consumption at the granularity of classes and methods. We argue that this per-method analysis of energy consumption provides better insights to the application in order to identify potential energy hotspots. In particular, our preliminary validation demonstrates that we can monitor energy hotspots of Jetty web servers and monitor their variations under stress scenarios.","","978-1-4503-1204-2","10.1145/2351676.2351699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494916","Bytecode Instrumentation;Power Model;Power Monitoring;Profiling","","energy consumption;file servers;green computing;Java;operating systems (computers);software engineering","software energy hotspots;GreenIT;software solution optimization;coarse-grained approach;process energy consumption;fine-grained runtime energy monitoring framework;2-layer architecture;process-level energy monitoring;OS-level energy monitoring;Java-based applications;Jetty Web servers","","13","","14","","8 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, two groups from academia and one from industry present the following three contributions. First, system reliability is considered from the perspective of novel timing guardband designs for aging mitigation. Effective timing guardband models are presented from the physical to the system level, while targeting multiple wear-out mechanisms. Second, a technique for correlating complex software and micro-architectural events with power integrity loss is presented. The presented technique uses an embedded voltage noise sensor, a power-network model and a genetic algorithm for identifying workload that triggers power-network resonances which can ultimately lead to system failures. Third, the `PRiME' cross-layer programming framework is presented that unites available sensors and dynamic-voltage and frequency scaling actuators with learning-based run-time process mapping and scheduling algorithms.

Decreasing power consumption on Web servers is currently a challenging new problem to be solved in a data center or warehouse. Although Web servers are configured to have maximum performance, the actual access rate to the servers can be small in a specific period, such as midnight, so it may be possible to reduce the power consumption of the servers while satisfying QoS with lower server performance. In order to reduce power consumption on the server nodes, we now have to consider the power consumption of the entire node rather than only processor power by Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). We implemented the proposed scheme to the distributed Web server system using the power-profile of server nodes and considering load increment based on traffic prediction method and evaluated the proposed scheme with a Web server benchmark workload based on SPECWeb99. The result reveals that the proposed scheme achieved an energy saving of approximately 17% with sufficient QoS performance on the distributed Web server system.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-1693-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2008.4536221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4536221","","Energy management","Internet;power consumption;power control;power engineering computing","power management;distributed Web servers system;server power state control;processor power control;quality of service;power consumption;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;DVFS;traffic prediction method;SPECWeb99","","5","","15","IEEE","3 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior work has focused on hard disk drive or file system energy management using custom-built measurement systems and models, but suffers from limitations that prohibit the attribution of the hardware energy consumption to the causative processes. This paper presents a novel process-level disk drive energy estimation system that monitors the operating system kernel to predict the storage power consumption created by individual processes of a software application. Evaluation reveals that the system is accurate with prediction errors around 7% even for workloads involving simultaneous file system operations from multiple processes. The system creates virtually no power consumption overhead in the CPU and about 4% overhead in the RAM module. Results using I/O benchmarks demonstrate that a large portion of the energy usage (up to 100% in some cases) in modern disk drives can occur after the causative processes have already completed execution. Hence, results obtained using power meters or direct energy measurement systems based solely on a benchmark's execution lifetime can drastically underestimate the benchmark application's storage energy demands.","","978-0-7695-5046-6","10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682064","energy efficiency;energy measurement;Linux kernel;power consumption;I/O scheduler;secondary storage","Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Kernel;Hard disks;Disk drives;Monitoring","disc drives;energy conservation;hard discs;operating system kernels;optimisation;power aware computing;power consumption;random-access storage;storage management","benchmark execution lifetime;storage energy demands;direct energy measurement systems;power meters;energy usage;I/O benchmarks;RAM module;CPU;power consumption overhead;simultaneous file system operations;prediction errors;software application;storage power consumption;operating system kernel;process-level disk drive energy estimation system;causative process;hardware energy consumption;custom-built measurement systems;file system energy management;energy efficiency;optimization;causative application processes;secondary storage devices;hard disk drives;process-level energy estimation","","6","","15","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces NeuroMeter, an integrated power, area, and timing modeling framework for ML accelerators. NeuroMeter models the detailed architecture of ML accelerators and generates a fast and accurate estimation on power, area, and chip timing. Meanwhile, it also enables the runtime analysis of system-level performance and efficiency when the runtime activity factors are provided. NeuroMeter's micro-architecture model includes fundamental components of ML accelerators, including systolic array based tensor units (TU), reduction trees (RT), and 1D vector units (VU). NeuroMeter has accurate modeling results, with the average power and area estimation errors below 10% and 17% respectively when validated against TPU-v1, TPU-v2, and Eyeriss.Leveraging the NeuroMeter's new capabilities on architecting manycore ML accelerators, this paper presents the first in-depth study on the design space and tradeoffs of “Brawny and Wimpy” inference accelerators in datacenter scenarios with the insights that are otherwise difficult to discover without NeuroMeter. Our study shows that brawny designs with 64x64 systolic arrays are the most performant and efficient for inference tasks in the 28nm datacenter architectural space with a 500mm2 die area budget. Our study also reveals important tradeoffs between performance and efficiency. For datacenter accelerators with low batch inference, a small (~16%) sacrifice of system performance (in achieved Tera OPerations per Second, aka TOPS) can lead to more than a 2x efficiency improvement (in achieved TOPS/TCO). To showcase NeuroMeter's capability to model a wide range of diverse ML accelerator architectures, we also conduct a followon mini-case study on implications of sparsity on different ML accelerators, demonstrating wimpier accelerator architectures benefit more readily from sparsity processing despite their lower achievable raw energy efficiency.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-2235-2","10.1109/HPCA51647.2021.00075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407039","accelerator;hardware modeling;deep learning","Analytical models;Runtime;Accelerator architectures;Tools;Energy efficiency;Timing;Task analysis","computer centres;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;power aware computing;systolic arrays;tensors","integrated power;timing modeling framework;architectural research;NeuroMeter models;chip timing;system-level performance;runtime activity factors;NeuroMeter's microarchitecture model;systolic array based tensor units;1D vector units;area estimation errors;architecting manycore ML accelerators;Brawny inference accelerators;Wimpy inference accelerators;area budget;datacenter accelerators;NeuroMeter's capability;wimpier accelerator architectures;ML accelerator architectures;machine learning accelerators industry track paper;datacenter architectural space;raw energy efficiency;artificial intelligence;size 28.0 nm","","3","","58","IEEE","22 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, the new algorithms, binary feedback alignment (BFA), and dynamic fixed-point based run-length compression (RLC), are proposed and reduce power consumption through the reduction of external memory accesses (EMA). The BFA and dynamic fixed-point-based RLC reduce the EMA by 11.4% and 32.5%, respectively. Third, the new data feeding units, including an integral RLC (iRLC) decoder and a transpose RLC (tRLC) decoder, are co-designed to maximize throughput alongside the proposed algorithms. Finally, a dropout controller in this processor reduces redundant power consumption coming from the unified core and the data feeding architecture by the proposed dynamic clock-gating scheme. This enables the proposed processor to operate DNN online learning with 38.1% lower power consumption. Implemented with 65 nm CMOS technology, the 3.52 mm2 DNN online learning processor shows 126 mW power consumption and the processor achieves 30.4 frames-per-second throughput in the object tracking application.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2018.2880363","Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion; Korea Government (MSIP)(grant numbers:2016-0-00207); Intelligent Processor Architectures and Application Softwares for CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)-RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8554277","Deep neural network;online learning;object tracking;feedback alignment;run-length compression;dynamic fixed-point representation;dropout","Object tracking;Target tracking;Throughput;Heuristic algorithms;Real-time systems;Neural networks;Power demand","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object tracking;power aware computing","65 nm CMOS technology;dynamic clock-gating scheme;dropout controller;data feeding units;external memory accesses;binary feedback alignment;mobile devices;redundant power consumption;transpose RLC decoder;integral RLC decoder;dynamic fixed-point-based RLC;dynamic fixed-point based run-length compression;BFA;unified core architecture;low-power DNN online learning;real-time object tracking application;low-power deep neural network online learning processor;power 126.0 mW","","29","","37","IEEE","30 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The foundation of many power/energy saving methods is based on power consumption models, which commonly rely on hardware performance monitoring counters (PMCs). Various events are provided by processor manufacturers to be monitored using PMCs. PMC event selection has been mainly based on architectural intuitions. However, efficient use of PMCs requires a carefully selected set of events. Therefore, a comprehensive study of PMC events with regards to power modeling is needed to understand and enhance such power models. In this paper, we study the relationship of PMC events with power consumption in the context of single-PMC and multi-PMC power models. Our OpenMP applications are from NAS Parallel Benchmark (BT, CG, LU, and SP) running on an AMD machine. We present the single-PMC selection results for each of our test applications, as well as a unified list for all four applications. Unlike other work that do not consider PMCs as each others' covariates, we present a method to select the most correlated set of PMC events for a given application. Our method finds the desired set of events with 6 times less number of executions compared to a principal component analysis (PCA) method. In addition, we have investigated variability of measurement for correlation coefficients. The 95% confidence interval of power-PMC and PMC-PMC correlation coefficients falls within 1.6% and 2.3% of their measured values, respectively. Furthermore, we study the power and PMC trends in the context of time-series and show that power estimates can be enhanced more than common regression methods. We show that the ARMAX model, a time-series candidate for real-time power estimation, can estimate system power consumption with a mean absolute error (total signal) of 0.1-0.5% in our applications.","","978-1-4673-2154-9","10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6322289","performance monitoring counters;power modeling;energy saving","Computational modeling;Power measurement;Correlation","energy conservation;performance evaluation;power aware computing;principal component analysis;time series","hardware performance monitoring counter selection;computing systems;power management;energy savings;high performance computing;design constraint;power consumption model;PMC event selection;single-PMC power model;multiPMC power model;OpenMP applications;NAS parallel benchmark;AMD machine;principal component analysis;PCA;PMC-PMC correlation coefficient measurement;time series;power estimates;ARMAX model;real-time power estimation;mean absolute error","","14","","18","IEEE","4 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This requires predicting what the resource requirements will be for an application. In the past, researchers have taken one of two approaches: design hardware monitors that can measure recent performance, or profile the application to determine the most likely behavior for each block of code. This paper explores a third option which is to combine hardware monitoring with software profiling to achieve lower power utilization than either method alone. We demonstrate the potential for this approach in two ways. First, we compare hardware monitoring and software profiling of IPC for code blocks and show that they capture different information. By combining them, we can control issue width and ALU usage more effectively to save more power. Second, we show that anticipating stalls due to critical load misses in the L2 cache can enable fetch halting. Again, hardware monitoring and software profiling must be used together to effectively predict misses and criticality of loads.","","0-7695-1889-3","10.1109/INTERA.2003.1192356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192356","","Software performance;Hardware;Monitoring;Application software;Energy consumption;Sampling methods;Iris;Power engineering and energy;Educational institutions;Cognitive science","power consumption;microprocessor chips;monitoring;performance evaluation;cache storage;computer architecture","power consumption;performance;hardware monitoring;software profiling;IPC;code blocks;L2 cache;fetch halting;miss prediction;high-end microprocessor design;instructions per cycle;load criticality;issue width;ALU usage","","8","","23","IEEE","8 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, monitoring and analyzing the power consumption of a distributed system spanning several-potentially heterogeneous-nodes becomes particularly tedious when aiming at a finer granularity than observing the power consumption of hosting nodes. While the state-of-the-art in software-defined power meters fails to deliver adaptive solutions to offer such service-level perspective and to cope with the diversity of hardware CPU architectures, this paper proposes to automatically learn the power models of the nodes supporting a distributed system, and then to use these inferred power models to better understand how the power consumption of the system's processes is distributed across nodes at runtime. Our solution, named WattsKit, offers a modular toolkit to build software-defined power meters ""à la carte"", thus dealing with the diversity of user and hardware requirements. Beyond the demonstrated capability of covering a wide diversity of CPU architectures with high accuracy, we illustrate the benefits of adopting software-defined power meters to analyze the power consumption of complex layered and distributed systems. In particular, we illustrate the capability of our approach to monitor the power consumption of a system composed of Docker Swarm, Weave, Elasticsearch, and Apache Zookeeper.

However, it poses a great technical challenge as the power of VMs co-existing in a physical machine cannot be measured directly. It is thus critical to develop a fair method to disaggregate the power of a physical machine to individual VMs. We tackle the above challenge by modeling the power disaggregation problem as a cooperative game and propose non-deterministic Shapley value to discover the fair power share of VMs (in the sense of satisfying four desired axiomatic principles), while compensating the negative impact of VM power variation. We demonstrate that the results from existing power model-based solution can deviate from the ""ground truth"" by 25.22% ~46.15%.

Virtual Machine (VM) migration technology can be applied to reduce energy consumption by consolidating VMs onto the minimal number of servers and turn idle servers into power-saving modes. While most existing energy models consider mainly computing energy, an enhanced energy consumption model is formulated, which includes energy consumption for computation, for servers to switch from standby to active modes, and for communication during VM migrations. Next, two new dynamic VM migration algorithms are proposed. They apply a local regression method to predict potentially over-utilized servers, and the 0-1 knapsack dynamic programming to find the best-fit combination of VMs for migration. The time complexity of these algorithms is analyzed, which indicates that they are highly scalable. Performance is evaluated and compared with existing algorithms. The two new heuristics have significantly reduced the number of VM migration, the number of rebooted servers, and energy consumption. Furthermore, one of them has achieved the least overall SLA violations. We believe that the new energy formulation and the two new heuristics contribute significantly towards achieving green cloud computing.","","978-1-4799-5313-4","10.1109/HPCSim.2014.6903785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903785","cloud computing;communication energy;energy formulation;energy efficiency;SLA;switching energy;virtual machine placement","Servers;Heuristic algorithms;Energy consumption;Switches;Prediction algorithms;Power demand;Computational modeling","cloud computing;computer centres;dynamic programming;energy consumption;green computing;power aware computing;regression analysis;virtual machines","dynamic virtual machine migration algorithms;green cloud computing;energy formulation;service level agreements;SLA violations;time complexity;0-1 knapsack dynamic programming;local regression method;power-saving modes;VM migration technology;green cloud data centers;energy consumption model","","35","","34","IEEE","22 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The high power consumption is not only attributed to the size of data centers but also to the ineptitude of resource usage. Most of the extant research has focused on reducing power consumption by an aggressive VM consolidation, which leads to the violation of the service level agreement (SLA). Furthermore, the unbalanced resource consumption exacerbates the unavailable wasted resources that are referred to as unavailable resource fragmentation. In this paper, we propose the use of a balanced resources consumption algorithm called BRC-IBMMT in order to enhance the efficiency of resource consumption while achieving an acceptable balance between conflicting correlation objectives of power consumption as well as SLA violation.

Existing studies have made great progress in this respect, but the following problems remain: first, the potential overload of the physical host is not considered in the load detection of the physical host; second, the resource-demand scaling of physical hosts is not considered during virtual machine (VM) placement, which results in the lack of accuracy in selecting suitable hosts. In view of the above problems, this study firstly constructs a virtual resource consolidation model based on green energy conservation (GEC-VRCM), which defines the specific process and related attributes of VMC, which is beneficial to improve the consolidation efficiency of virtual resources. Second, based on this model, we propose a dynamic virtual machine consolidation algorithm based on balancing energy consumption and quality of service (EQ-DVMCA) to achieve efficient consolidation of virtual resources.

In addition, unlike existing works based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model structure, which only works for basic blocks with a small number of instructions, DeepPM provides highly accurate results for long basic blocks, which takes the majority of the execution time for actual application runs. In our evaluation conducted with SPEC2006 benchmark suite, we show that DeepPM can provide accurate prediction for performance and power consumption with 10.2% and 12.3% error, respectively.

Although our analysis leaves out some important dimensions due to lack of publicly available data, the stable ridge regression model can easily be expanded to accommodate new dimensions (indicators). The results show that even with the most lenient assumptions regarding the behaviour of the ICT sector, it is a significant consumer of energy at the national level. As Nepal is suffering from the chronic problem of energy crisis, further development of the ICT sector will surely raise new energy related challenges. The understanding of the context of energy use is as important as the technology that delivers energy savings.

In order to resolve these issues, we propose two VM packing algorithms, a matching-based (MBA) and a greedy-type heuristic (GREEDY). MBA enables to decide an optimal plan in polynomial time, while GREEDY is an aggressive packing approach faster than MBA. We investigate the basic performance and the feasibility of proposed algorithms under both artificial and realistic simulation scenarios, respectively.

The rise of innovative prediction methods able to handle the high volatility of users' electrical load has posed the basis to accomplish this task. However these methods, which mostly rely on Artificial Neural Networks, require that a huge amount of users' fine-grained sensitive consumption data are centrally collected to train a generalized forecasting model, with implications on privacy and scalability. This paper proposes an innovative architecture specifically designed to overcome this need. By exploiting Federated Learning and Edge Computing capabilities, many Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are locally trained by different users based on their own historical energy consumption samples. Such models are then aggregated by a specific-purpose node to build a generalized model that is re-distributed for improved forecasting at the edge. For better forecasting, our proposed local training procedure takes as input relevant features related to calendar (i.e., hour, weekday and average consumption of previous days) and weather conditions (i.e., clustered apparent temperature), and the architecture can group users according to consumption similarities (using K-means) or socioeconomic affinities. We thoroughly evaluate the approach through simulations, showing that it can lead to similar forecasting performance than a state-of-the-art centralized solution in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), but with up to an order of magnitude lower training time and up to 50 times less exchanged data when samples are recorded at finer granularity than one hour. Nonetheless, it keeps sensitive data local and therefore guarantees users' privacy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3094089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9469923","Energy consumption forecasting;federated learning;edge computing;LSTM","Forecasting;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Data models;Training;Energy consumption;Load modeling","data privacy;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;mean square error methods;power consumption;power engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;socio-economic effects","local training procedure;magnitude lower training time;federated learning;residential short-term energy consumption forecasting;decentralized power systems;artificial neural networks;fine-grained sensitive consumption data;generalized forecasting model;innovative architecture;historical energy consumption samples;long short-term memory;edge computing;LSTM;clustered apparent temperature;K-means;socioeconomic affinities;root mean square error;RMSE;users privacy","","22","","73","CCBY","1 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With an increase in its adoption, a growing concern is related to its economic and environmental cost (as is also the case for other machine learning techniques). Unfortunately, little work has been done to optimize its energy consumption or emissions of carbon dioxide or equivalents, as energy minimization is usually left as a secondary objective. In this paper, we investigate the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of FL training on heterogeneous devices by controlling the workload distribution. We model this as the Minimal Cost FL Schedule problem, a total cost minimization problem with identical, independent, and atomic tasks that have to be assigned to heterogeneous resources with arbitrary cost functions. We propose a pseudo-polynomial optimal solution to the problem based on the previously unexplored Multiple-Choice Minimum-Cost Maximal Knapsack Packing Problem. We also provide four algorithms for scenarios where cost functions are monotonically increasing and follow the same behavior. These solutions are likewise applicable on the minimization of other kinds of costs, and in other one-dimensional data partition problems.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2023.3240833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10032558","Dynamic programming;energy conservation;federated learning;knapsack problems;machine learning;optimization;parallel processing;scheduling","Training;Energy consumption;Costs;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Data models;Task analysis","energy consumption;knapsack problems;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;scheduling","carbon dioxide;economic cost;edge devices;energy minimization;environmental cost;federated Learning;heterogeneous mobile devices;local data private;machine learning models;minimal cost FL schedule problem;minimal energy consumption;multiple-choice minimum-cost maximal knapsack packing problem;one-dimensional data partition problems;pseudopolynomial optimal solution;scheduling algorithms;total cost minimization problem","","","","45","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data centers usually incur enormous power consumption and are expected to have a significant impact on the local power grid due to dramatically increasing power consumption and fluctuation. In order to mitigate such fluctuation and balance the power demand and supply in the power grid in real time, the regulation service (RS) opportunity has been provided, which offers the electricity consumers to dynamically adjust their power consumption and reduce their electricity cost. Data centers can be active RS participants due to their flexibility and controllability in load dispatching and scheduling temporally (within a server) and spatially (among multiple servers). In order for the data centers to provide better RS, prediction on the data center power consumption becomes essential. In this work, we first adopt artificial neural network (ANN)-based method and long short term memory (LSTM) neural network-based method for the prediction of future data center power consumption. Based on the prediction results, we formulate a novel optimal power management problem of data center to minimize the total cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the total cost of the data center can be reduced by up to 20.6% compared with the baseline systems.","1948-3287","978-1-5090-5404-6","10.1109/ISQED.2017.7918343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7918343","Data center;power management;smart grid;regulation service;artificial neural network;long short term memory network","Power demand;Servers;Cloud computing;Memory management;Biological neural networks;Neurons","cloud computing;computer centres;controllability;cost reduction;load dispatching;load shedding;minimisation;neural nets;power aware computing;power consumption;power system economics;smart power grids","data center power management;regulation service;neural network-based power prediction;cloud computing;cloud service providers;local power grid;power fluctuation;power demand;power supply;RS opportunity;electricity consumers;electricity cost reduction;load dispatching;load scheduling;controllability;artificial neural network;ANN-based method;long short term memory;LSTM neural network-based method;data center power consumption prediction;optimal power management;total cost minimization;smart grid","","11","","30","IEEE","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the initialization stage the server is monitored for a specific period of time to collect energy consumption historical raw data for identifying associations between the server energy consumption states and the appropriate optimization actions. In the self-optimization stage, energy consumption server state snapshots are taken at regular time intervals and formally represented using a biologically-inspired antigen model. The obtained antigen is then classified as self (optimal energy consumption state) or non-self (non-optimal energy consumption state) using a set of detectors obtained in the initialization stage.

In this context, most of the existing solutions rely on aggressive virtual machine migration, thus resulting in unnecessary overhead and energy wastage. Besides, virtual machine consolidation should take into account multiple resource types at the same time, since CPU is not the only critical resource in cloud data centers. In fact, also memory and network bandwidth can become a bottleneck, possibly causing violations in the service level agreement. This article presents a virtual machine consolidation algorithm with multiple usage prediction (VMCUP-M) to improve the energy efficiency of cloud data centers. In this context, multiple usage refers to both resource types and the horizon employed to predict future utilization. Our algorithm is executed during the virtual machine consolidation process to estimate the long-term utilization of multiple resource types based on the local history of the considered servers. The joint use of current and predicted resource utilization allows for a reliable characterization of overloaded and underloaded servers, thereby reducing both the load and the power consumption after consolidation. We evaluate our solution through simulations on both synthetic and real-world workloads.

In this paper, different kinds of hyperparameters are automatically determined by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) to CNN-LSTM network for forecasting energy consumption. Our findings reveal that the proposed optimization strategy can be used as a promising alternative prediction method for high prediction accuracy and better generalization capability.

In this paper, we experimentally investigate the scope and usefulness of DVFS in a server environment. We set up a multimedia server which will be used in two different scenarios. In the first scenario, the server will host requests to download video files of known and available formats. In the second scenario, videos of unavailable formats can be accepted; in which case the server employs a trans coder to convert between AVI, MPEG and SLV formats before the videos are downloaded. The workload we generate has a uniform arrival rate and an exponentially distributed video size. We use four dynamic scaling policies which are widely used with existing mainstream Linux operating systems. Our observation is that while the gain of DVFS is clear in the first scenario (in which a predominantly IO-bound application is used), its use in the second scenario is rather counterproductive.","2159-6190","978-1-4673-2892-0","10.1109/CLOUD.2012.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253579","Energy consumption of servers;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;power consumption analysis;dynamic power management;energy consumption","Servers;Power demand;Voltage control;Throughput;Multimedia communication;Energy consumption;Regulators","computer centres;Linux;multimedia servers;power aware computing","power consumption analysis;multimedia server;DVFS policies;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;power management strategy;embedded systems;mobile devices;wireless sensor networks;data centers;optimal resource pool sizing;video files;distributed video size;dynamic scaling policies;Linux operating systems","","12","","22","IEEE","2 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper experimentally investigates the relationship between the power consumption and resource utilization of a multimedia server cluster when different load balancing policies are used to distribute a workload. Our observations are the following: (1) A bottleneck on a single hardware resource can lead to a significant amount of underutilization of the entire system. (2) A ten times increment in the network bandwidth of the entire cluster can double the throughput of individual servers. The associated increment in power consumption of the individual servers is 1.2% only. (3) For TCP-based applications, session information is more useful than other types of status information to utilize power more efficiently. (4) The use of dynamic frequency scaling does not affect the overall throughput of IO-bound applications but reduces the power consumption of the servers; but this reduction is only 12% of the overall power consumption.

However, effective SSD bandwidth management is essential to cope with the high request rates for popular video files stored on SSDs. To address this problem, we propose a new SSD cache management scheme for a video server that uses multi-speed disks. First, we introduce a storage allocation scheme to examine how the presence of an SSD cache affects disk bandwidth consumption. We then propose an SSD bandwidth allocation algorithm to minimize energy consumption by allowing disks to run at lower speeds while achieving jitter-free disk speed transitions and by limiting the number of transitions to ensure disk reliability.

In this paper, we propose a novel distance measurement and build a time series classification algorithm hybridizing nearest neighbor and long short term memory (LSTM) neural network. More specifically, first we propose a new distance measurement termed as local time warping (LTW), which utilizes a user-specified index set for local warping, and is designed to be noncommutative and nondynamic programming. Second, we hybridize the 1-nearest neighbor (1NN)-LTW and LSTM together. In particular, we combine the prediction probability vector of 1NN-LTW and LSTM to determine the label of the test cases. Finally, using the power consumption data from a real data center, we show that the proposed LTW can improve the classification accuracy of dynamic time warping (DTW) from about 84% to 90%. Our experimental results prove that the proposed LTW is competitive on our data set compared with existed DTW variants and its noncommutative feature is indeed beneficial. We also test a linear version of LTW and find out that it can perform similar to state-of-the-art DTW-based method while it runs as fast as the linear runtime lower bound methods like LB_Keogh for our problem. With the hybrid algorithm, for the power series classification task we achieve an accuracy up to about 93%.

These two facts force us to consider different software approaches in the mobile device kernel that can conserve battery life and reduce latency, which is the duration of time between the inception of an event and the reaction to the event. One area to consider is a software package called the display server. The display server is middleware that handles all GUI activities between an application and the operating system, such as event handling and drawing to the screen. In both desktop and mobile devices, the display server is located in the application layer. However, the kernel layer contains most of the information needed for handling events and drawing graphics, which forces the application-level display server to make a series of system calls in order to coordinate events and to draw graphics. These calls interrupt the CPU which can increase both latency and power consumption, and also require the kernel to maintain event queues that duplicate event queues in the display server. A further drawback of placing the display server in the application layer is that the display server contains most of the information required to efficiently schedule the application and this information is not communicated to existing kernels, meaning that GUI-oriented applications are scheduled less efficiently than they might be, which further increases power consumption. We propose moving the display server to the kernel layer, so that it has direct access to many of the event queues and hardware rendering systems without having to interrupt the CPU. This adjustment has allowed us to implement two power saving strategies, discussed in other papers, that streamline the event system and improve the scheduler. The combination of these two techniques reduces power consumption by an average of 30 percent and latency by an average of 17 ms. Even without the implementation of these power saving techniques, the KDS increases battery life by 4.35 percent or on average about 10 extra minutes for a typical mobile phone or 30 extra minutes for a typical tablet computer. It also reduces latency by 1.1 milliseconds.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2857809","US National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1617198); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8413093","Graphical user interfaces;kernel display server;event handling","Servers;Kernel;Mobile handsets;Rendering (computer graphics);Graphical user interfaces;Power demand;Androids","graphical user interfaces;middleware;mobile computing;notebook computers;power aware computing;power consumption;rendering (computer graphics);software packages","application layer;kernel layer;drawing graphics;application-level display server;power consumption;duplicate event queues;kernel-level display server;mobile device kernel;reducing event latency;desktop devices;GUI-oriented applications;CPU;graphical user interface;KDS;middleware","","2","","30","IEEE","19 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Information on the energy efficiency of a server for a given target workload can greatly influence such decisions and thus the final energy efficiency of a cluster or data center. However, measuring energy efficiency and power consumption of server applications has become challenging as applications are often distributed or require work intensive configuration, setup, and specialized load drivers for reproducible testing. As a result, it may be not feasible to perform tests using the actual workload that is to be deployed. We introduce an approach to create small-scale workloads that emulate the power consumption-relevant behavior of an application by deliberately triggering specific power relevant performance counter events. These workloads can then be easily deployed on a target server for fast and efficient power characterization. We validate the proposed approach by approximating the power consumption behavior of different workloads at multiple load levels. We show that our approach is capable of producing small-scale workloads that reflect the power consumption behavior of their reference applications over multiple load levels with a minimum error of less than 1%.","2375-0227","978-1-5386-2764-8","10.1109/MASCOTS.2017.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8107442","Energy Efficiency;Power;Benchmarking;CPU;Performance Counter;Workload;NFV;SERT;PET","Power measurement;Power demand;Servers;Phase measurement;Hardware;Software;Calibration","computer centres;file servers;power aware computing","power consumption behavior;server workloads;CPU performance counters;server applications;power consumption-relevant behavior;energy efficiency;data center;specific power relevant performance counter events","","1","","23","IEEE","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The power consumption models and information they provide can then be used to make better decisions for data center orchestration, e.g., whether to migrate virtual machines to reduce power consumption. We propose a scalable system that would 1) create initial power consumption models, as needed, for data center components, and 2) could be continually refined while the components are in use. The models will be used for the near real-time monitoring of power consumption, as well as predicting power consumption before and after potential orchestration decisions. The first step towards this goal of whole data center power modeling and prediction is to be able to predict the power consumption of one server effectively, based on high level utilization statistics from that server. In this paper we present a novel method for modeling whole system power consumption for a server, under varying random levels of CPU utilization, with a scalable random forest based model, that utilizes statistics available at the data center management level.","","978-0-7695-5697-0","10.1109/UCC.2015.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7431425","power consumption models;power consumption estimation;server power consumption;processor power consumption;virtual machines;random forests;energy-efficiency","Power demand;Servers;Monitoring;Benchmark testing;Load modeling;Data models;Computational modeling","computer centres;power aware computing;virtual machines","servers;2010 data centers;data center management level;scalable random forest based model;CPU utilization;whole data center power modeling;data center components;reduce power consumption models;virtual machines;data center orchestration;SDDC;software defined data center;power consumption modeling/monitoring system;global electricity production","","1","","20","","14 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CNN extracted time-domain, and frequency-domain features are merged as time-frequency fusion features, which fully reflect the changing power consumption trend. The time-frequency fusion features are fed into LSTM to mining the features which have a long-time dependency. The comprehensive features are the fusion of time-domain and frequency-domain features with a long-time dependency, which are utilized for power consumption forecasting.

It is well-known that federated learning (FL) can be used to build a global energy predictor for smart grids without revealing the customers’ raw data to preserve privacy. However, it still reveals local models’ parameters during the training process, which may still leak customers’ data privacy. In addition, for the global model to converge, it requires multiple training rounds, which must be done in a communication-efficient way. Moreover, most existing works only focus on load forecasting while neglecting energy forecasting in net-metering systems. To address these limitations, in this article, we propose a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient FL-based energy predictor for net-metering systems. Based on a data set for real power consumption/generation readings, we first propose a multidata-source hybrid deep learning (DL)-based predictor to accurately predict future readings. Then, we repurpose an efficient inner-product functional encryption (IPFE) scheme for implementing secure data aggregation to preserve the customers’ privacy by encrypting their models’ parameters during the FL training. To address communication efficiency, we use a change and transmit (CAT) approach to update local model’s parameters, where only the parameters with sufficient changes are updated. Our extensive studies demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts future readings while providing privacy protection and high communication efficiency.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3230586","Makkah Digital Gate Initiative(grant numbers:MDP-IRI-7-2022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005179","Communication efficiency;energy prediction;federated learning (FL);privacy preservation;smart grids","Predictive models;Servers;Privacy;Data models;Forecasting;Training;Smart grids","blockchains;cryptography;data aggregation;data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;power consumption;power engineering computing;smart power grids;telecommunication computing","communication-efficient energy prediction scheme;communication-efficient FL-based energy predictor;communication-efficient way;customers;efficient inner-product functional encryption scheme;energy forecasting;equipment failures;federated learning;FL training;future readings;global energy predictor;global model;high communication efficiency;infrastructure planning;load forecasting;local model;local models;multidata-source hybrid deep learning-based predictor;multiple training rounds;net-metering systems;power dispatching;power outages;privacy protection;privacy-preserving;secure data aggregation;smart grids;training process","","4","","38","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the time-dependency characteristics between successive energy demand data, the stochasticity of the number of EVs, and the randomness of the energy demand data of EVs and prosumers cause challenges in accurately predicting energy demand. Therefore, it is urgent to do energy demand prediction for prosumers. Nevertheless, energy demand prediction through centralized training is an extravagant process. This is because transferring energy data to a centralized machine for prediction will not only cause network bandwidth and energy consumption, but also cause communication delay. Thus, in this paper, an edge-assisted attention-based federated learning (FL) algorithm is proposed for multi-step energy demand prediction of prosumers, where the goal is to minimize the average forecasting loss. Specifically, since the attention mechanism has the advantage of detecting important features from inputs, to capture the temporal features and improve the prediction accuracy, the long short-term memory-utilized sequence to sequence model with the attention mechanism (LSTM-Seq2Seq-att) in FL setting is employed in each local edge server to train the global model collaboratively.

Currently, static thermal setpoints are typically used to maintain the inside temperature of a building at a comfortable level irrespective of its occupancy. This paper introduces a deep learning framework that trains across time series to forecast the temperatures of a future period directly where a particular room is unoccupied and optimises the setpoints of the room. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use a state-of-the-art deep learning method trained across series to accurately predict temperatures for the subsequent optimal control of room setpoints. In contrast to traditional forecasting approaches that build isolated models to predict each series, our framework uses global recurrent neural network models that are trained with a set of relatively short temperature series, allowing the models to learn cross-series information. The predicted temperatures were then used to define the optimal thermal setpoints to be used inside the room during the unoccupied periods. We evaluate the prediction accuracy of our deep learning framework against a set of state-of-the-art forecasting models and can outperform those by a large margin. Furthermore, we analyse the usage of our deep learning framework to optimise the energy consumption of an air conditioning system in a real-world scenario using temperature data from a university lecture theatre. Based on simulations, we show that our proposed framework can lead to savings of approximately 20% and 15%, respectively, compared to the traditional temperature control model that does not use optimisation techniques and a programmable thermostat.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3142174","Honeywell International Inc.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9676657","Deep learning;energy optimisation;generative models;recurrent neural networks;temperature forecasting","Predictive models;Forecasting;Buildings;HVAC;Deep learning;Energy consumption;Support vector machines","air conditioning;building management systems;energy conservation;energy consumption;learning (artificial intelligence);optimal control;optimisation;recurrent neural nets;renewable energy sources;temperature control;thermostats;time series","generative deep learning framework;time series;energy consumption;air conditioning system;active buildings;efficient demand management;energy efficiency;building inefficiencies;energy wastage;energy-related expenses;static thermal setpoints;particular room;state-of-the-art deep learning method;subsequent optimal control;room setpoints;global recurrent neural network models;cross-series information;predicted temperatures;optimal thermal setpoints;state-of-the-art forecasting models;temperature data;traditional temperature control model;short temperature series","","1","","55","CCBY","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the increase in energy demand, governments started searching for solutions to reduce energy wastage on the demand side, and the deployment of smart meters was one of them. Their purpose was to give users information about the aggregated energy consumed in a given household at any given time. Since the smart meters collect the aggregated readings, the interest in NILM grew, as researchers could focus their attention on the disaggregation algorithm. Regarding the disaggre-gation algorithms, deep learning models have shown remarkable results surpassing the previous state-of-the-art models. With this in mind, this paper proposes three different deep learning models: a convolutional neural network with residual blocks, a recurrent neural network, and a multilayer perceptron that uses discrete wavelet transform as features. These models are trained on the UK-DALE and REFIT datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art models present in NILMTK-Contrib.

A reliable weather forecast would result in a more efficient management of the available energy and would make it easier to take advantage of the modern types of power-grid based on renewable energy resources. In this paper, we exploit the capabilities provided by the FIESTA-IoT platform in order to investigate the correlation between the weather conditions and the energy consumption in DCs. Then, by using multi-variable linear regression process we model this correlation between the energy consumption and the dominant weather condition parameters in order to effectively forecast the energy consumption based on the weather forecast. This procedure could be part of a wider resources optimization process in the core network towards an end-to-end (e2e) access/core network optimization of resources utilization. We have validated our results through live measurements from the RealDC testbed. Results from our proposed approach indicate that forecasting of energy consumption based on weather conditions could help not only DC operators in managing their cooling systems and power usage, but also electricity companies in optimizing their power distribution systems.","","978-1-5386-1335-1","10.1109/CSNDSP.2018.8471785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8471785","FIESTA-IoT;energy efficiency;weather forecast;data centers;linear regression;machine learning;power grid;remote sensing","Energy consumption;Cooling;Predictive models;Weather forecasting;Data centers;Data models","computer centres;energy consumption;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;power distribution;power grids;regression analysis;remote sensing;weather forecasting","energy consumption forecasting;data centers;weather conditions;remote sensing;machine learning approach;reliable weather forecast;renewable energy resources;dominant weather condition parameters;DC;telecommunications operators;operational reliability;power-grid;realDC testbed;e2e access-core network optimization;end-to-end access-core network optimization;multivariable linear regression process;FIESTA-IoT platform","","13","","13","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reliable dynamic simulation is a chimera because of the complex design and behavior of these buildings. Therefore, monitoring-based methods arise as a plausible alternative. Its main drawback, however, is the lack of enough data to generate statistically robust models. The paper faces this problem thanks to the helpful contribution of a collaborative hospital which was able to generate daily data of electrical energy consumption for a period of six years. Besides, thirteen variables that summarize the daily activity of the hospital are also included. The results show how machine learning techniques generate models that accurately predict the electrical energy consumption based on weather conditions and activity measurements.

Recently, there have been a strong interest to use intelligent tools especially Neural Networks in energy efficient approaches of Wireless Sensor Networks, due to their simple parallel distributed computation, distributed storage, data robustness, autoclassification of sensor nodes and sensor reading. This paper presents a new centralized adaptive Energy Based Clustering protocol through the application of Self organizing map neural networks (called EBC-S) which can cluster sensor nodes, based on multi parameters; energy level and coordinates of sensor nodes. We applied some maximum energy nodes as weights of SOM map units; so that the nodes with higher energy attract the nearest nodes with lower energy levels. Therefore, formed clusters may not necessarily contain adjacent nodes. The new algorithm enables us to form energy balanced clusters and equally distribute energy consumption.

At the intersection of these trends, in this paper we focus on the energetic characterization of machine learning at the edge, which is attracting increasing attention. Unfortunately, calculating the energy consumption of a given neural network during inference is complicated by the heterogeneity of the possible underlying hardware implementation. In this work, we aim at profiling the energetic consumption of inference tasks for some modern edge nodes by deriving simple but accurate models. To this end, we performed a large number of experiments to collect the energy consumption of fully connected and convolutional layers on two well-known edge boards by NVIDIA, namely, Jetson TX2 and Xavier. From these experimental measurements, we have then distilled a simple and practical model that can provide an estimate of the energy consumption of a certain inference task on these edge computers. We believe that this model can prove useful in many contexts as, for instance, to guide the search for efficient neural network architectures, as a heuristic in neural network pruning, to find energy-efficient offloading strategies in a split computing context, or to evaluate and compare the energy performance of deep neural network architectures.","","978-3-903176-49-2","10.23919/WiOpt56218.2022.9930584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9930584","Energy consumption;Deep Neural Networks;Edge Computing;Inference","Deep learning;Energy consumption;Computational modeling;Wireless networks;Neural networks;Computer architecture;Market research","data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);device drivers;inference mechanisms;power aware computing;telecommunication computing","energy consumption;edge computers;neural network pruning;energy-efficient offloading strategies;deep neural network architectures;NVIDIA edge boards;deep learning inference tasks;energetic sustainability;machine learning;energetic consumption;edge nodes;neural network energy consumption;Jetson TX2;Xavier;data privacy","","","","14","","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the multi-step computation of data streams and heterogeneous task dependencies, task failure frequently occurs, resulting in poor user experience and additional energy consumption. To reduce task execution failure as well as energy consumption, we propose a novel AI-driven energy-aware proactive fault-tolerant scheduling scheme for CDCs in this paper. First, a prediction model based on the machine learning approach is trained to classify the arriving tasks into “failure-prone tasks” and “non-failure-prone tasks” according to the predicted failure rate. Then, two efficient scheduling mechanisms are proposed to allocate two types of tasks to the most appropriate hosts in a CDC.

However, the IoT devices are usually limited by their computing capability and battery lifetime. Mobile edge computing provides new opportunities for developments of IoT, since edge computing servers which are close to devices can provide more powerful computing resources. The IoT devices can offload the intensive computing tasks to edge computing servers, while saving their own computing resources and reducing energy consumption. However, the benefits come at the cost of higher latency, mainly due to additional transmission time, and it may be unacceptable for many IoT applications. In this paper, we try to find a tradeoff between the energy consumption and latency, in order to satisfy user demands of various IoT applications. We formalize the problem into a constrained multiobjective optimization problem and find the optimal solutions by a modified fast and elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). To improve the performance of the algorithm, we propose a novel problem-specific encoding scheme and genetic operators in the proposed modified NSGA-II.

First, we introduce the role of the delay threshold in reducing delay. Then, we describe the delay and energy consumption of the mobile terminal layer, fog node layer and cloud server layer with queue theory.

Given an application G containing a set N of tasks {n1,...,n|N|}, and a system containing a set U of processors {u1,..., u|U|}, the power-aware task scheduling generally refers to finding the appropriate processor and frequency for each task ni, so as to make sure that all the tasks can be finished efficiently and the overall energy consumption is guaranteed. In this article, we study the problem of minimizing the schedule length for energy consumption constrained parallel applications on heterogeneous computing systems, where the schedule length refers to the time interval between starting the first task and finishing the last task. For this problem, existing work adopts a policy that preassigns the minimum energy consumption for each unassigned task. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals that, such a pre-assignment policy could be unfair for the low priority tasks, and it may not achieve an optimistic schedule length. Thereby, we propose a new task scheduling algorithm that suggests a weight-based mechanism to preassign energy consumption for unassigned tasks, and we provide the rigorous proof to show its feasibility. Further, we show that this idea can be extended to solve reliability maximization problems with energy consumption constraint or with both deadline and energy consumption constraints, where the reliability refers to the probability of executing application G without failures, and the deadline constraint refers to the “allowable” maximum schedule length. We have conducted extensive experiments based on real parallel applications.

The computing tasks of each UD can be divided into two parts: one portion is processed locally and the remaining portion is offloaded to the UAV for computing. Offloading is enabled by uplink and downlink communications between UDs and the UAV. On this basis, two types of access modes are considered, namely, nonorthogonal and orthogonal multiple access. For both access modes, we formulate new optimization problems to minimize the weighted-sum energy consumption of the UAV and UDs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and computation resource allocation, under the constraint on the number of computation bits. These problems are nonconvex optimization problems that are difficult to solve directly. Accordingly, we develop alternating iterative algorithms to solve them based on the block alternating descent method. Specifically, the UAV trajectory and computation resource allocation are alteratively optimized in each iteration.

Before systems such as supercomputers, servers, and datacenters can begin operating in an energy-efficient manner, the energy consumption and performance characteristics of the system must be analyzed. In this paper, we provide an analysis framework that will allow a system administrator to investigate the tradeoffs between system energy consumption and utility earned by a system (as a measure of system performance). We model these trade-offs as a bi-objective resource allocation problem. We use a popular multi-objective genetic algorithm to construct Pareto fronts to illustrate how different resource allocations can cause a system to consume significantly different amounts of energy and earn different amounts of utility. We demonstrate our analysis framework using real data collected from online benchmarks, and further provide a method to create larger data sets that exhibit similar heterogeneity characteristics to real data sets. This analysis framework can provide system administrators with insight to make intelligent scheduling decisions based on the energy and utility needs of their systems.","","978-0-7695-4979-8","10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650868","bi-objective optimization;energy-aware computing;heterogeneous computing;resource allocation;data creation","Resource management;Energy consumption;Optimization;Computational modeling;Benchmark testing;US Department of Defense;Power demand","energy consumption;genetic algorithms;performance evaluation;resource allocation","analysis framework;system performance;system energy consumption;heterogeneous computing environment;energy-efficient computing;bi-objective resource allocation problem;system performance measurement;multiobjective genetic algorithm;Pareto fronts","","19","","26","IEEE","31 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It pushes the computational resources in close proximity to the data sources and thus, caters for the explosive growth of vehicular applications. Owing to the high mobility of vehicles, these applications are of latency-sensitive requirements in most cases. Accordingly, such requirements still pose a great challenge to the computing capabilities of VEC, when these applications are outsourced and executed in VEC. Against this backdrop, we propose a new mathematical model, which, respectively, generalizes the computation and communication models, and applies application-oriented caching into VEC in this article. Based on this model, a new strategy is further proposed to optimize the average response time of applications over an infinite time-slotted horizon for VEC. A long-term energy consumption constraint is imposed to guarantee the stability of the VEC system, and the Lyapunov optimization technology is adopted to tackle this constraint issue.

The enhanced capabilities of these access networks has spearheaded the cloud computing paradigm, where the end-users aim at having the services accessible anytime and anywhere. The services availability is also related with the end-user device, where one of the major constraints is the battery lifetime. Therefore, it is necessary to assess and minimize the energy consumed by the end-user devices, given its significance for the user perceived quality of the cloud computing services. In this paper, an empirical methodology to measure network interfaces energy consumption is proposed. By employing this methodology, an experimental evaluation of energy consumption in three different cloud computing access scenarios (including WiMAX) were performed. The empirical results obtained show the impact of accurate network interface states management and application network level design in the energy consumption. Additionally, the achieved outcomes can be used in further software-based models to optimized energy consumption, and increase the Quality of Experience (QoE) perceived by the end-users.","","978-1-4577-1667-6","10.1109/NCCA.2011.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6123444","Cloud Computing;Energy;Measurement;Testbed;Wireless;4G networks","IEEE 802.11 Standards;WiMAX;Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Cloud computing;Network interfaces;Universal Serial Bus","cloud computing;energy consumption;IP networks;Long Term Evolution;network interfaces;next generation networks;WiMax","energy consumption measurement;cloud computing wireless testbed;next generation network;wireless broadband access technology;Long Term Evolution;LTE;worldwide interoperability for microwave access;WiMAX;all-IP network;access network;services availability;battery lifetime;network interface;application network level design;quality of experience","","10","","14","IEEE","9 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, DVFS energy management often has difficulty balancing GPU performance and energy efficiency. This paper aims to implement a DVFS energy management strategy. We constructed a new type of neural network to a GPU-based energy management scheme, implemented the global-based DVFS model, and explored its implementation details. Using a master-slave model, we built a global energy control solution strategy. This strategy performs global collaborative DVFS adjustments on the GPU's energy consumption module based on task characteristics. Through the software construction and implementation of the global-based DVFS model, we proved that the strategy improves the GPU performance while improving the GPU's energy efficiency.

Minimizing the energy consumption of precedence constrained workflows with cost budget constraints has become one of the popular topics in cloud data centers. Most existing scheduling algorithms mainly consider execution time or cost of a given workflow application under a budget constraint; however, these algorithms do not adequately consider energy saving. A reducing energy consumption strategy using a critical task remapping (RMREC) algorithm is proposed in this study. This algorithm is decomposed into two phases: energy consumption reduction and critical task remapping. In the first phase, the adjustable cost budget and spare cost are determined on the basis of cost budget, critical task path, and adjustable budget factor. All workflow tasks are further allocated to virtual machines (VMs) with the lowest energy consumption to achieve preliminary mapping between tasks and VMs while satisfying the adjustable cost budget constraint. In the second phase, critical tasks are remapped to VMs according to spare cost to decrease energy consumption caused by task migration. Experiments on two types of workflow applications with different scales demonstrate that the presented RMREC algorithm effectively reduces energy consumption without violating cost budget constraints compared with existing algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037205","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1003401); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702178,61672224,61871432); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019JJ50123,2018JJ4063,2018JJ4068,2019JJ60054,2019JJ60008,2020JJ6087); Key Program of Education Bureau of Hunan Province(grant numbers:17A052); Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province(grant numbers:20C0625,18C0528); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201808430297); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9253551","Cost budget constraint;energy consumption;heterogeneous cloud computing systems;workflow application","Task analysis;Energy consumption;Cloud computing;Scheduling algorithms;Scheduling;Computational modeling;Quality of service","cloud computing;computer centres;energy consumption;power aware computing;scheduling;virtual machines;workflow management software","energy consumption strategy reduction;RMREC algorithm;energy consumption scheduling algorithm minimization;workflow tasks;adjustable budget factor;critical task path;critical task remapping;energy consumption reduction;workflow application;existing scheduling algorithms;cloud data centers;precedence constrained workflows;large-scale workflow applications;heterogeneous cloud computing systems;spare cost;adjustable cost budget constraint;lowest energy consumption","","6","","36","CCBYNCND","10 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Fog computing paradigm represents a distributed architecture closer to the end-user. Its necessity and feasibility keep being demonstrated in recent works. However, its impact on energy consumption is often neglected and the integration of renewable energy has not been considered yet. The goal of this work is to exhibit an energy-efficient Fog architecture considering the integration of renewable energy.

Our simulation results, based on real traces, show that the intrinsic low computing capability of the nodes in a Fog context makes it harder to exploit renewable energy.

Although by utilizing static techniques along with creating data centers energy consumption is relatively reduced, the rapid growth of cloud computing due to the increasing demands of users for these resources has changed energy consumption to a potential challenge. Utilizing dynamic energy reduction techniques which can be possible through the integration of the virtual machine into at least one physical server can be considered as an effective solution to this problem. This is done through live virtual machine migration and selecting the migration candidate virtual machine is a key step in this technique. In this paper, the combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is used to choose the appropriate migration candidate virtual machine which leads to the diagnosis of whether a virtual machine is sensitive to latency or not.

However, the SPM is typically controlled by software, which is less adaptive to runtime instruction/data access patterns that are dependent on the input data and hence may lead to performance degradation. In this paper, we study the energy dissipation of a number of hybrid on-chip memory architectures by combining both caches and SPMs without increasing the total on-chip memory size. In the hybrid SPM-cache architectures, the instructions/data in the SPMs can be accessed more energy-efficiently, while other instructions/data not stored into the SPMs can exploit the cache to take advantage of runtime locality for reducing energy consumption. Our experimental results indicate that with the equivalent total on-chip memory size, several hybrid SPM-cache architectures are more energy-efficient than either pure software-controlled SPMs or pure hardware-controlled caches. In particular, using the hybrid SPM-cache to store both instructions and data can achieve the best energy efficiency.","","978-1-4799-6123-8","10.1109/HPCC.2014.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056763","","System-on-chip;Energy consumption;Memory management;Resource management;Benchmark testing;Program processors","cache storage;embedded systems;energy consumption;memory architecture","hybrid SPM-cache architectures;energy consumption;embedded computing;scratch-pad memories;embedded systems;time predictability;energy efficiency;runtime instruction/data access patterns;energy dissipation;hybrid on-chip memory architectures;hardware-controlled caches","","2","","33","IEEE","12 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider a single-user-single-server MEC system, working under latency constraint. In order to reduce the energy consumption of mobile device and meet the latency constraint, we use computation offloading to accomplish large tasks. However, energy consumed by mobile devices (MD) for the transmitting process could be decreased further by compressing data transmitted from MD to mobile-edge server (MEC server). But energy consumed when compressing data on MD increases while the compression rate decreases. Therefore, we develop a solution to figure out the optimal compression rate to minimize the total energy for MD to accomplish one simple task and to meet the latency constraint at the same time. With the optimal compression rate, energy consumption for task-process could be reduced by 38.37% to 60.49% when the latency constraint varies from 0.1s to 0.8s.","2377-8644","978-1-7281-7327-6","10.1109/ICCC49849.2020.9238837","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901052); 111 project(grant numbers:B17007); Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence(grant numbers:2017BKL-NSAC-ZJ-02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9238837","MEC;computation offloading;data compression;energy optimal problem","Energy consumption;Simulation;Minimization;Mobile handsets;Servers;Task analysis;Edge computing","data compression;distributed processing;energy conservation;mobile computing;optimisation;power aware computing;power consumption;telecommunication computing;telecommunication power management","energy consumption minimization;energy consumption;transmitting process;latency constraint;task-process;optimal compression rate;compression rate decreases;mobile-edge server;computation offloading;mobile device;single-user-single-server MEC system;energy optimal solutions;MEC server;energy minimization;mobile edge computing;data compression","","2","","16","IEEE","9 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This service permits us to face the issues caused by the ever-increasing energy demand such as grid congestion during peak hours, increasing energy generation costs, and even blackouts. In this paper, we investigate the problem of consumer-side optimization of residential energy demand. Our main aim is to better distribute the energy consumption over a day to avoid or reduce the demand during peak hours. Hence, we propose a fog computing-based model for energy demand scheduling using energy consumption cost as an incentive. In this model, the fog nodes schedule the appliances’ operations in order to reduce the individual and global energy bills whilst respecting consumers’ preferences. The proposed approach performs a multi-agent system-based cooperative scheduling game with minimal interactions between the nodes. Moreover, we present a fog nodes’ assignment scheme to decide which node will handle which appliances’ schedules. The nodes’ assignment strategy aims to optimize the use of fog nodes’ resources whilst reducing the scheduling process latency. The performance evaluation shows that the use of fog computing can achieve interesting results in terms of the reduction of energy consumption cost. For instance, the energy consumption during peak hour decreases by more than 25% from 670 kWh to 500 kWh when the scheduling game is performed. As a consequence, the energy consumption cost decreases by 7% from 806 € to 750 € .","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2022.3174698","European Commission; Grand-Est region, France; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773980","Energy demand management;energy consumption scheduling;game theory;fog-computing;cooperative scheduling game;smart grid","Processor scheduling;Costs;Optimization;Games;Edge computing;Smart grids;Scheduling","building management systems;demand side management;edge computing;energy consumption;game theory;multi-agent systems;power engineering computing;scheduling;smart power grids","appliances;consumer-side optimization;electricity grids;energy 500.0 kWh to 670.0 kWh;energy consumption cost reduction;energy consumption scheduling;energy demand management;energy demand scheduling;energy generation costs;fog computing service;fog computing-based model;fog nodes;global energy bills;grid congestion;interesting services;multiagent system-based cooperative scheduling game;node assignment strategy;peak hour;residential energy demand;scheduling game;scheduling process;smart grid technologies","","2","","50","IEEE","12 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accordingly, besides regarding the amount of energy consumed by user devices, it is also necessary to take into account that of energy consumed by edge servers. In this paper, we propose effective heuristics for offloading tasks from multi-user devices to multi-core edge servers with the objective of minimizing the total amount of energy consumption under the deadline constraint. The proposed heuristics start from initial task sequences that are generated by the well-known long and short task first rules, respectively. Then, tasks from the initial task sequences are scheduled in a greedy manner so that the considered total amount of energy consumption can be minimized without the violation of the deadline constraint.

To address these issues, this paper presents a new energy-efficient “Multifunctional Neural Network” (MNN) that uses a variety of different activation functions to effectively improve performance and significantly reduce energy consumption. A generic training algorithm is designed to optimize the weights, biases, and function selections for improving performance while still achieving relatively fast computational time and reducing energy usage.

However, sending tasks to the cloud reduces the power consumed by the users’ devices, but increases the transmission delay of the tasks. In contrast, sending tasks to the fog server reduces the transmission delay due to the shorter distance between the user and the server. However, this occurs at the user end’s expense of higher energy consumption. Thus, this study proposes a mathematical framework for workload allocation to model the power consumption and delay functions for both fog and clouds. After that, a Modified Least Laxity First (MLLF) algorithm was proposed to reduce the maximum delay threshold. Furthermore, a new multi-objective approach, namely the Non-dominated Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO), is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. The simulation results show that NPSO outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm in reducing energy consumption, while NGSA-II proves its effectiveness in reducing transmission delay compared to the other algorithms in the experimental simulation.

Then, without the requirements for domain experts, we propose Bayesian optimization-based computation offloading (BOCO) method to find the optimal offloading decision. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply Bayesian optimization to computation offloading in VEC. Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments and comparisons with other offloading methods to analyze the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results verify that our proposed BOCO outperforms counterparts.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3221966","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972302,61962019); Shaanxi Key Technology Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2021ZDLGY07-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9951058","Bayesian optimization (BO);computation offloading;energy consumption;Quality of Service (QoS);vehicular edge computing (VEC)","Task analysis;Energy consumption;Quality of service;Delays;Computational modeling;Optimization;Edge computing","edge computing;energy consumption;Internet of Things;minimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;vehicular ad hoc networks","bandwidth resources;Bayesian optimization-based computation offloading;BOCO method;delay minimization;edge servers;energy consumption minimization;Internet of Vehicles;low-delay services;optimal offloading decision;QoS-aware co-offloading;quality-of-service requirements;VEC;vehicular edge computing","","","","43","IEEE","15 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various approximate methods have been proposed in the literature that demonstrate the effectiveness of relaxing accuracy requirements in a specific unit. This provides a basis for exploring simultaneous use of multiple approximate units to improve efficiency under guarantees on quality of results. In this paper, we explore the effect of combining multiple approximate units on the energy consumption and identify the best setting that minimizes energy consumption under a quality constraint. Our approach also enables changes in unit configurations throughout the program. To do this effectively, we need a method to examine the combined impact of multiple approximate units on the output quality, and configure individual units accordingly. To solve this problem, we propose LEMAX that uses gradient descent approach to identify the best configuration of the individual approximate units for a given program. We evaluate the efficacy of LEMAX in minimizing the energy consumption of several machine learning applications with varying size (i.e., number of operations) under different quality constraints. Our evaluation shows that the configuration provided by LEMAX for a system with multiple approximate units improves the energy consumption by on average, 97.7%, 83.12%, and 73.95% for quality loss of 5%, 2% and 0.5%, respectively, compared to configurations obtained for a system with a single approximate resource.","","978-1-5386-4114-9","10.1109/DAC.2018.8465881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8465881","Approximate computing;Design Automation;Machine Learning","Energy consumption;Measurement;Approximate computing;Error analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Adders;Optimization","approximation theory;energy conservation;energy consumption;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation","machine learning application;gradient descent approach;configure individual units;energy efficiency;quality guarantee;approximate computing;learning-based energy consumption minimization;LEMAX","","","","16","IEEE","20 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a new method for predicting software energy consumption to help debug software energy issues. Our approach enables developers to align traces of software behavior with traces of software energy consumption. This allows developers to match run-time energy hot spots to the corresponding execution. We accomplish this by applying recent neural network models to predict time series of energy consumption given a software's behavior. We compare our time series models to prior state-of-the-art models that only predict total software energy consumption.

Strengthened by the limited practical knowledge to reduce the energy consumption, organizations have less control over the energy impact of their products and lose the contribution of software towards energy related strategies. Consequently, industry risks not being able to meet customer requirements or even fulfillcorporate sustainability goals. In this paper we perform an exploratory case study on how to create and maintain awareness on an energy consumption perspective for software among stakeholders involved with the development of software products. During the study, we followed the development process of two commercial software products and provided direct feedback to the stakeholders on the effects of their development efforts, specifically concerning energy consumption and performance, using an energy dashboard.

However, while hardware power-saving mechanisms cannot handle short idle periods of high-performance parallel applications, prior code/data reorganization strategies typically require extensive code modifications. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a compiler-directed data access (I/O call) scheduling framework for saving disk energy, which groups as many data requests as possible in a shorter period, thus creating longer disk idle periods for improving the effectiveness of hardware power-saving mechanisms.

A naive solution to this problem would be to have an exhaustive suite of test cases that are executed upon every change to measure their effect on energy consumption. This method is inefficient and also suffers from environment dependent inconsistencies. A more generalized method would be to relate software structural metrics with its energy consumption behavior. Previous attempts to relate change in objectoriented metrics to their effects on energy consumption have been inconclusive. We observe that structural information is global and executed tests are rarely comprehensive in their coverage, this approach is prone to errors.

Moreover, the optimization of a process implementation and software development can lead to second order impacts, also referred to as indirect impacts. Finally, the third other impact considers the user's behaviors and consciousness regarding the concept of sustainability. In order to mitigate these negative impacts, the purpose of this research is to identify, via systematic literature review, the practices of sustainable software engineering reported by the academy applied in the industry.

It outperforms traditional TCP in terms of performance and reliability. On the other hand, the emergence of software-defined networking (SDN) has made a momentous change in traditional network management and control. It makes the networks programmable via a controller that manages the entire network. However, energy consumption represents a significant issue when using multihomed devices since most of the wireless devices used in emerging technologies such as Internet-of-things and fog computing are battery-powered. This paper aims to answer the question of whether the current literature addresses controlling the energy consumption of MPTCP connections using SDN. Thus, the paper reviews the current research works that target MPTCP energy consumption for wireless connections and the usage of SDN to manage those connections. Our review finds that energy efficiency remains an open research challenge while controlling it in multipath devices effectively by using SDN is not well explored in the literature.","","978-1-7281-8301-5","10.1109/ICREGA50506.2021.9388293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9388293","Multipath TCP;heterogeneous wireless networks;software-defined networking;Internet of things;fog computing;5G;energy consumption","Wireless communication;Energy consumption;Renewable energy sources;Routing;Reliability;Standards;Resilience","cloud computing;computer network management;energy consumption;Internet of Things;power aware computing;telecommunication power management;transport protocols","fog computing;Internet of Things;MPTCP energy consumption;MPTCP connections;wireless devices;multihomed devices;network management;uninterrupted communication;standard TCP;multipath transmission control protocol;software-defined networking;wireless multipath TCP connections;multipath devices;energy efficiency;SDN","","1","","51","IEEE","30 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One important contributing factor is the number of times the wires are charged and discharged, i.e., how often they switch from ‘0’ to ‘1’ and vice versa. We describe a software technique to minimize this switching activity in GPUs, thereby lowering the energy usage. Our technique targets the memory bus, which comprises many high-capacitance wires that are frequently used. Our approach is to strategically change data values in the source code such that loading and storing them yields fewer bit flips. The new values are guaranteed to produce the same control flow and program output. Measurements on GPUs from two generations show that our technique allows programmers to save up to 9.3% of the whole-GPU energy consumption and 1.2% on average across eight graph-analytics CUDA codes without impacting performance.","","978-1-6654-7282-1","10.1109/MCHPC56545.2022.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024054","bit flips;energy consumption;memory;GPUs","Energy consumption;High performance computing;Source coding;Wires;Memory management;Loading;Graphics processing units","graph theory;graphics processing units;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;power aware computing;power consumption;random-access storage","contributing factor;data values;energy usage;graph-analytics CUDA codes;high-capacitance wires;high-performance computing;memory-bus energy consumption;software technique;software-based bit-flip minimization;source code;switching activity;whole-GPU energy consumption","","","","25","IEEE","24 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In light of this, a solution which offers robust and reliable low energy consumption SDR radiometer in spite of the increased electromagnetic spectrum congestion is needed. One promising genetic algorithm (GA) that could form the basis of a potential solution is the Software-Defined Radio (SDR). The core of an SDR's functionality is implemented in MATLAB R2019b software, allowing the system to alter its functionality while it is operating. Further, SDRs enable fully cognitive radios which have an Internet of Things (IoT) back-end to allow them to autonomously react and adapt to their transmission environment with no user interaction. A real-time engine is one that executes while the network is running and periodically updates operating parameters to tune the network's performance to its current environment. The maximum energy voltage recorded at 77.18 volts in maximum time of 4900 seconds recorded through simulation using SDR based radiometer with noisy signals as well as standard deviation.

Among those, efficiently avoiding race conditions through synchronization is one of the greatest difficulties in concurrent programming. Transactional memories have been proposed to reduce the issues and limitations found on previous synchronization techniques based in locks, such as mutexes, semaphores, and monitors. The use of transactions allows for a higher abstraction on writing code, leaving for the compiler or library the determination of which variables can be accessed concurrently. The runtime system is responsible for detecting conflicts during execution, and solving them in a way that the desired semantics is preserved. In this context, this paper analyzes energy consumption and performance of three Software Transactional Memory implementations, TL2, TinySTM, and Swiss TM, using the STAMP benchmarks. Different from previous works, the workloads are not simulated but executed in a computer. The results show that TinySTM and Swiss TM have very similar performance, even more when the number of threads is increased. On the other hand, TL2 presents worse performance for all benchmarks but Genome. Energy consumption closely follows the same trend, as no specific power management is employed, hence execution time is the main variable determining power.","","978-1-4673-4468-5","10.1109/WSCAD-SSC.2012.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6391782","software transactional memories;green computing;parallel processing","Benchmark testing;Instruction sets;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Hardware;Computational modeling","concurrency control;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;program compilers;storage management;synchronisation;system monitoring;transaction processing","energy consumption;software transactional memory;multicore architecture;software development;concurrent programming;synchronization technique;mutexes;semaphores;code writing;compiler;library;concurrent access;runtime system;conflict detection;TL2;TinySTM;Swiss TM;STAMP benchmark;Genome;power management;execution time","","","","16","IEEE","24 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Often motivated by optimization objectives, software products are characterized by different subsequent releases and deployed through different strategies. The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products. Aims. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure. Method. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption. Results. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency. Conclusions. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered. The number of machines involved in a software deployment strategy does not simply constitute an additive effect of the energy consumption of the underlying hardware infrastructure.","","978-1-5090-4039-1","10.1109/ESEM.2017.39","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8170112","Energy;Software Releases;Deployment","Software;Energy consumption;Hardware;Energy measurement;Optimization;Software measurement;Market research","energy consumption;power aware computing;software engineering;software maintenance;software packages;software quality","KPMG case study;energy consumption;third-party software product;execution time;software releases;energy optimisation;software energy efficiency;software deployment strategy;energy impact;use case scenario","","4","","26","IEEE","11 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially, frailty syndrome is one of the most significant challenges faced by many countries because of its high association with mortality and hospitalization. Recently, with the progress of ICT (Information and Communication Technology), many frailty detection models which use sensors were proposed. However, many of them require very high costs caused by the installation and management of sensors. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a machine learning-based frailty detection model using only electric power consumption data from smart meter, which uses no other devices such as sensors. Also, we examined the feasibility of our model through a case study, in which we have conducted on 24 elderly people.

This paper considers the additional vulnerability of machine learning models when attackers can measure the power consumption of their underlying hardware platform. In particular, we explore the utility of power consumption information for adversarial attacks on non-volatile memory crossbar-based single-layer neural networks. Our results from experiments with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that power consumption can reveal important information about the neural network’s weight matrix, such as the 1-norm of its columns. That information can be used to infer the sensitivity of the network’s loss with respect to different inputs. We also find that surrogate-based black box attacks that utilize crossbar power information can lead to improved attack efficiency.","2164-1706","978-1-6654-5985-3","10.1109/SOCC56010.2022.9908114","Air Force Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9908114","","Power demand;Sensitivity;Power measurement;Nonvolatile memory;SPICE;Particle measurements;Behavioral sciences","AI chips;learning (artificial intelligence);memory architecture;neural nets;power consumption;random-access storage;security of data","adversarial attacks;attack efficiency;CIFAR-10 dataset;crossbar power information;hardware platform;in-memory computing;machine learning models;mission-critical autonomous systems;MNIST dataset;neural network weight matrix;nonvolatile memory crossbar-based single-layer neural network;NVM crossbar-based ML accelerators;power consumption information;security;single-layer NVM crossbar-based neural networks;surrogate-based black box attacks","","","","17","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In terms of modeling, we exploit the principal component analysis to approximate the exogenous load and show its full relevance; 2. Under some reasonable but improvable assumptions, this work provides a full characterization of the set of feasible payoffs which can be reached by a set of appliances having partial information; 3.

Firstly, to get over this dilemma, a two-tier architectural model for slice-MEC system is proposed, which is mainly divided into the slice instance layer and infrastructure layer. Next, we establish the optimization problem of minimizing weighted power consumption cost while guaranteeing requirements of delay and rate, taking into account both communication and computational resources.

The power consumed by an OLED-based display is directly proportional to the luminance of the image pixels. In this paper, a novel idea is proposed to generate energy-efficient images, which consume less power when shown on an OLED-based display. The Blue color component of an image pixel is the most power-hungry i.e. it consumes more power as compared to the Red and Green color components. The main idea is to reduce the intensity of the blue color to the best possible level so that the overall power consumption is reduced while maintaining the perceptual quality of an image. The idea is inspired by the famous ""Land Effect"", which demonstrates that it is possible to generate a full-color image by using only two color components instead of three. experiments are performed on the Kodak image database. The results show that the proposed method is able to reduce the power consumption by 18% on average and the modified images do not lose the perceptual quality.

The threat of reducing a customer's battery-life now hangs over the software developer who asks, “will this next change be the one that causes my software to drain a customer's battery?” One solution is to detect power consumption regressions by measuring the power usage of tests, but this is time-consuming and often noisy. An alternative is to rely on software metrics that allow us to estimate the impact that a change might have on power consumption thus relieving the developer from expensive testing. This paper presents a general methodology for investigating the impact of software change on power consumption, we relate power consumption to software changes, and then investigate the impact of static OO software metrics on power consumption. We demonstrated that software change can effect power consumption using the Firefox web-browser and the Azureus/Vuze BitTorrent client.

During the recent years, energy efficient algorithms and protocols to maximize network lifetime have attracted the attention of many researchers. As the radio transceiver is one of the elements of the node that has higher power consumption, a typical approach to save energy is to minimize the period of time it is active. That can be achieved by introducing a duty cycle in which the node periodically enables its radio for a short time to later return to an idle state. In this paper, we discuss the importance of the duty cycle window size and present an expression to determine it according to the particularities of the IEEE 802.15.4 specification. But, to obtain a more accurate expression, we show that it is necessary to consider the characteristics of a noisy channel, especially in industrial applications, where interferences cannot be underestimated. The proposed technique tries to minimize electromagnetic pollution in order not to disturb the normal operation of other radio devices in the environment. The results of a real implementation are also presented and its efficiency discussed in terms of boundary conditions.","","978-1-4673-2232-4","10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6625014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625014","Wireless Sensor Networks;Energy saving;Duty Cycle;Software management","Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Power demand;Wireless communication;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Protocols;Hardware","electromagnetic interference;interference suppression;power aware computing;power consumption;protocols;radio transceivers;software management;wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","boundary conditions;radio devices;electromagnetic pollution;noisy channel characteristics;IEEE 802.15.4 specification;duty cycle window size;radio transceiver;protocols;energy efficient algorithms;network lifetime maximization;wireless sensor network;battery-operated nodes;duty cycle algorithms;WSN;power consumption;software management","","6","","24","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, software solutions are typically orders of magnitude less efficient than dedicated hardware in terms of power consumption and processing speed. Consequently, realizing highly-efficient, massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) solutions in software, while exploiting the wide 5G transmission bandwidths, becomes extremely challenging and requires the massive parallelization of the PHY processing tasks. In this work, for the first time, we show that massively parallel software solutions are capable of meeting the processing requirements of 5G New Radio (NR), still, with a significant increase in the corresponding power consumption. In this context, we quantify this power consumption overhead, both in terms of Watts and carbon emissions, as a function of the concurrently transmitted information streams, of the base-station antennas, and of the utilized bandwidth. We show that the computational power consumption of such PHY processing is no longer negligible and that, for mMIMO solutions supporting a large number of information streams, it can become comparable to the power consumption of the Radio Frequency (RF) chains. Finally, we discuss how a shift towards non-linear PHY processing can significantly boost energy efficiency, and we further highlight the importance of energy-aware digital signal processing design in future PHY processing architectures.","","978-1-6654-5975-4","10.1109/GCWkshps56602.2022.10008564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10008564","power efficiency;software-based 5G NR;Open RAN;massive MIMO","Radio frequency;Power demand;Software architecture;Transmitting antennas;Bandwidth;New Radio;Physical layer","5G mobile communication;MIMO communication;power consumption;radio access networks;software architecture;telecommunication computing","5G new radio;5G physical layer processing;base station antennas;computational power consumption;corresponding power consumption;energy aware digital signal processing design;future PHY processing architectures;general tendency;massive multiple-input multiple-output solutions;massive parallelization;massive-MIMO;massively parallel software solutions;mMIMO solutions;nonlinear PHY processing;open radio access network;PHY processing tasks;power consumption overhead;radio frequency chains;software architectures;software-based PHY processing;wide 5G transmission bandwidths","","","","26","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Composite Cores Architecture (CCA) is a class of dynamic heterogeneous architectures that empowers the system to build the most appropriate core at run-time for each application by composing cores together to make larger core or decomposing a large core into multiple smaller cores. While CCA provides more flexibility for the running application to find the best run-time configurations to maximize energy-efficiency, due to the interdependence of various tuning parameters such as the core type, run-time voltage and frequency setting, and number of threads, it makes the scheduling more challenging. In this work, we investigate the scheduling challenges of multithreaded applications on CCA architectures. This paper describes a systematic approach to predict the right configurations for running multithreaded workloads on the composite cores architecture. It achieves this by developing a machine learning-based approach to predict core type, voltage and frequency to maximize the energy-efficiency. Our predictor learns offline from an extensive set of training multithreaded workloads. It is then applied to predict the optimal processor configuration at run-time by considering of the multithreaded application's characteristics and the optimization objective. For this purpose, five well-known machine learning models are implemented for energy-efficiency optimization and precisely compared in terms of accuracy and hardware overhead to guide the scheduling decisions in a CCA. The results show that while complex machine learning models such as MultiLayerPerceptron are achieving higher accuracy, after evaluating their implementation overheads, they perform worst in terms of power, accuracy/area and latency as compared to simpler but slightly less accurate regression-based and tree-based classifiers.","1063-6404","978-1-5386-2254-4","10.1109/ICCD.2017.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8119201","energy-efficiency;heterogeneous architecture;composite cores;scheduling;machine learning","Conferences","learning (artificial intelligence);microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;multi-threading;pattern classification;power aware computing;regression analysis","run-time voltage;frequency setting;CCA architectures;composite cores architecture;multithreaded application;energy-efficiency optimization;complex machine learning models;energy-efficiency prediction;dynamic heterogeneous architectures;multiple smaller cores;running application;run-time configurations;composite core architectures","","24","","27","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing solutions for temperature estimation are inefficient due to their computational complexity and lack of accurate prediction. However, data-driven machine learning methods for temperature prediction is a promising approach. In this regard, we collect and study data from a private cloud and show the presence of thermal variations. We investigate several machine learning models to accurately predict the host temperature. Specifically, we propose a gradient boosting machine learning model for temperature prediction. The experiment results show that our model accurately predicts the temperature with the average RMSE value of 0.05 or an average prediction error of 2.38 °C, which is 6 °C less as compared to an existing theoretical model.

MEC and Energy Harvesting (EH) BSs, i.e., BSs equipped with EH equipments, are foreseen as a key towards next generation mobile networks. In fact, EH systems are expected to decrease the energy drained from the electricity grid and facilitate the deployment of BSs in remote places, extending network coverage and making energy self-sufficiency possible in remote/rural sites.

With the increasing concerns of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change in recent years, the significance of the performance in terms of sustainability of manufacturing has been gradually recognized by both academia and industry. Various researches have been implemented to analyze, model, and reduce the energy consumption of manufacturing activities toward sustainable manufacturing. In a typical manufacturing system with multiple machines and buffers, the state of a certain machine is not only determined by the machine itself, but also the states of the adjacent machines and buffers. Therefore, machines may be in idle states due to nonincoming part from the upstream section of the manufacturing system or noncapacity to hold the delivered part to the downstream section of the manufacturing system. Those idle machines consume energy without production if there is no appropriate energy control strategy. In this article, we focus on the reduction of the energy waste for those idle machines in a typical multi-machine and multi-buffer manufacturing system. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) integrated neural network is proposed to predict the duration of the idle periods for the idle machines, during which optimal energy control action can be identified and implemented under the constraint of production throughput of the manufacturing system. A manufacturing system simulator is built to provide the training dataset including the information, such as production throughput, energy consumption, buffer content, and failure rate, to the proposed neural network. A numerical case study for a five-machine-and-four-buffer manufacturing system is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed prediction model in terms of the energy waste reduction for the idle machines. Note to Practitioners—This article proposes a prediction model to forecast the idle duration of the manufacturing machines in a typical multi-machine and multi-buffer manufacturing system. With this predicted result, two concerns in energy control for the idle machine, i.e., throughput protection and energy consumption reduction, can be more accurately modeled in decision-making procedure. Optimal energy control actions under the constraints of throughput maintaining and energy saving can be identified and implemented considering different warmup energy consumption and warmup time of the machines to reduce the energy waste for those machines in idle states without any production and thus, improve the energy efficiency of the entire manufacturing system.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2019.2938662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8842588","Energy control;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);idle time prediction;manufacturing system;neural network","Manufacturing systems;Energy consumption;Throughput;Energy states;Neural networks;Climate change;Gaussian processes","energy conservation;energy consumption;Gaussian processes;manufacturing systems;neural nets;optimisation;power control;scheduling;sustainable development;waste reduction","idle duration prediction;Gaussian mixture model integrated neural network;energy efficiency improvement;manufacturing activities;energy consumption;climate change;sustainable manufacturing;typical manufacturing system;multiple machines;adjacent machines;idle states;idle machines;appropriate energy control strategy;typical multimachine;multibuffer manufacturing system;optimal energy control action;manufacturing system simulator;five-machine;-four-buffer manufacturing system;energy waste reduction","","6","","13","IEEE","17 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For 4G/5G-based cellular communication systems, the effective transmission power of uplink data transmissions is of crucial importance for the overall system power consumption. Unfortunately, this information is usually hidden within off-the-shelf modems and mobile handsets and can therefore not be exploited for enabling green communication. Moreover, the dynamic transmission power control behavior of the mobile device is not even explicitly modeled in most of the established simulation frameworks. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning-based approach for forecasting the resulting uplink transmission power used for data transmissions based on the available passive network quality indicators and application-level information. The model is derived from comprehensive field measurements of drive tests performed in a public cellular network and can be parameterized for integrating all measurements a given target platform is able to provide into the prediction process. In a comparison of three different machine learning methods, Random-Forest models thoroughly performed best with a mean average error of 3.166 dB. As the absolute sum of errors converges towards zero and falls below 1 dB after 28 predictions in average, the approach is well-suited for long-term power estimations.","2577-2465","978-1-5386-6358-5","10.1109/VTCFall.2018.8690629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8690629","","Machine learning;Power demand;Predictive models;Uplink;Data models;Data communication;Long Term Evolution","4G mobile communication;cellular radio;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;mobile handsets;mobile robots;power consumption","application-level information;comprehensive field measurements;public cellular network;prediction process;Random-Forest models;long-term power estimations;uplink transmission power prediction;passive downlink indicators;energy-aware system design;static Internet;mobile Internet;highly resource-constrained vehicles;mobile robotic systems;4G/5G-based cellular communication systems;effective transmission power;uplink data transmissions;system power consumption;off-the-shelf modems;mobile handsets;green communication;dynamic transmission power control behavior;mobile device;machine learning methods;uplink transmission power;passive network quality indicators;mobile Internet of Things-based sensor nodes","","18","","22","IEEE","14 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large database is required in order to perform essential analysis tasks such as power, thermal, and IR-drop analysis, which, in turn, leads to long run times. This work focuses on test power analysis. Due to the large number of test patterns for modern designs and the excessive power analysis run time for each test, it is not feasible to obtain complete power profiles for all the tests. However, test power-safety is essential to produce reliable manufacturing test results and prevent yield loss and chip damage. Accurate power profiling can typically be done for a small subset of pre-selected tests only. An essential task is therefore to determine those tests, which potentially provide the worst-case scenarios with respect to test power. We propose machine learning-based power prediction for test selection. The prediction is applied in two different ways. First, we predict the activity of a test to identify tests with high power consumption. Second, the switching activity and the power information are related to the layout of the chip to identify local hot spots. Various machine learning-based algorithms are used to evaluate this approach. Additionally, the algorithms are compared against each other.

This encouraged designers to design wider and deeper register files with multiple read and write ports to increase their throughput. Nevertheless, larger register files consume higher energy/access, leak more power, and occupy larger areas on the chip. This portrays a significant issue in the field of chip design due to the limited energy resources in mobile devices that dominate today’s market. Therefore, it becomes crucial for chip designers to devise new mechanisms that help them study the effect of increasing the register file capabilities on those characteristics at an early stage during the design process. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques, and with a reasonable degree of success have been used to predict the energy characteristics of a register file based on three parameters: the number of words in the file (D), the number of bits in one word (W) and the total number of Read and Write Ports (P). In this work, and using the same attributes, we attempt to predict the values of energy/access, leakage power, and occupied silicon area in register files using several machine learning algorithms to assess design alternatives and their energy and area tradeoffs. We compare our best algorithm to the ANN-based model reported in the literature using the same dataset. Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were able to achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.991, 0.991, and 0.989 when predicting energy/access, leakage power, and silicon area, respectively. On the other hand, the designed artificial neural network (ANN) achieves correlation coefficients of 0.974, 0.982, and 0.987, while the closest algorithms in performance to SVM achieve 0.917, 0.980, and 0.987, respectively. The results of the conducted experiments prove that SVM produce superior results when compared to ANN and other algorithms while maintaining a reasonable model training time and consuming lesser computational resources in most cases.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3172287","Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Open Access Program from the American University of Sharjah; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766373","Register files;power consumption;leakage power;support vector machine","Registers;Mathematical models;Machine learning;Predictive models;Machine learning algorithms;Linear regression;Silicon","computer architecture;flip-flops;learning (artificial intelligence);logic design;neural nets;power aware computing;support vector machines","chip design;energy resources;chip designers;register file capabilities;design process;Artificial Neural Network techniques;ANN;energy characteristics;leakage power;silicon area;designed artificial neural network;consuming lesser computational resources;power prediction;computer architecture;processor design","","","","34","CCBYNCND","3 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current scheduling strategies distribute tasks between cores according to a count of available cores, b ut ignore the execution time and energy implications of task aggregation (i.e., grouping multiple tasks within the same node or the same multicore processor). Task aggregation can save significant energy while sustaining or even improving performance. However, choosing an effective task aggregation becomes more difficult as the core count and the options available for task placement increase. We present a framework to predict the performance effect of task aggregation in both computation and communication phases and its impact in terms of execution time and energy of MPI programs.

Estimating future electricity needs is critical to the success of any electricity provider. Having accurate predictions of electricity use has several practical and financial benefits, including ensuring the security and stability of the power grid. This research employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to anticipate electricity usage, aiming to resolve the discrepancy between the need for precise prediction and the limitations of conventional methods. The model incorporates conventional LSTM and hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM). First, we’ll examine the Kaggle data we collected on electricity consumption. Second, we utilize an RNN model to forecast future power consumption as a whole. Finally, we will utilize loss and Mean Square Error (MSE) to qualitatively and statistically assess the performance of the model.

Hence, the design of such application-specific IoT devices becomes a time-consuming and effort-hungry process, that poses the need for accurate and effective automated assisting methods.In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimate the power consumption of CUDA-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on GPGPUs in the early design phases. The proposed approach takes advantage of a hybrid technique where static analysis is used for features extraction and the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) regression analysis is utilized for power estimation model generation. Using K-NN analysis, the power estimation model can even be created with small training datasets.

One of the effective approaches for saving energy in a cluster environment is workload consolidation. However, it is challenging to address this schedule problem as it requires the understanding of various cost factors. One of the important factors is the estimation of power consumption. Power models used in most of workload schedule solutions are a linear function of resource features, but we analysed the measurement data from our cluster and found the resource loads, in particular I/O load, had no convincing linear-correlation with power consumption. Based on measurement data sets from our cluster, we propose multiple non-linear machine learning approaches to estimate power consumption of an entire node using OS-reported resource features. We evaluate the accuracy, portability and usability of the linear and non-linear approaches. Our work shows the multiple-variable linear regression approach is more precise than the CPU only linear approach. The neural network approaches have a slight advantage - its mean root mean square error is at most 15% less than that of the multiple-variable linear approach. But the neural network models have worse portability when the models generated on a node are applied on its homogeneous nodes. Gaussian Mixture Model has the highest accuracy on Hadoop nodes but requires the longest training time.","","978-1-4799-6177-1","10.1109/IGCC.2014.7039145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7039145","Power Model;Workload Characterization;Energy Monitoring;Machine learning","Power demand;Estimation;Biological system modeling;Neurons;Computational modeling;Training;Google","computer centres;Gaussian processes;input-output programs;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;mixture models;neural nets;power aware computing;regression analysis;scheduling;software portability","power estimation approaches;computing cluster;data centers;cloud applications;grid applications;energy cost;carbon dioxide emissions;power distribution;cooling;energy saving;workload consolidation;cost factors;power consumption estimation;power models;workload schedule;source loads;training time;Hadoop nodes;Gaussian mixture Model;mean root mean square error;neural network approaches;multiple-variable linear regression approach;usability evaluation;portability evaluation;accuracy evaluation;OS-reported resource features;multiple nonlinear machine learning approaches;measurement data sets;I/O load","","","","29","IEEE","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
