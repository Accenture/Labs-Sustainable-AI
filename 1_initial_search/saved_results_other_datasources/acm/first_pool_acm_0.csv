Implementing an accurate and effective carbon emission monitoring model requires the collaboration of many parties because carbon emission-related data involves many sectors and industries. However, for the relevant characteristics of carbon emission monitoring, due to the different collection and storage standards of various departments, poor maintenance environment, lack of data, data loss, and abnormal severe, resulting in high frequency and high precision carbon emission monitoring. As privacy protection and data security issues are gradually taken seriously by government departments and related enterprises, the inability or unwillingness to share carbon emission-related data among enterprises or even among various departments within enterprises has created an increasingly severe data silo phenomenon.

Yet, VM-based systems are nowadays commonly used to host multiple applications for cost savings and better use of energy by sharing common resources and assets.In this paper, we propose a fine-grained monitoring middleware providing real-time and accurate power estimation of software processes running at any level of virtualization in a system. In particular, our solution automatically learns an application-agnostic power model, which can be used to estimate the power consumption of applications.Our middleware implementation, named BitWatts, builds on a distributed actor implementation to collect process usage and infer fine-grained power consumption without imposing any hardware investment (e.g., power meters). BitWatts instances use high-throughput communication channels to spread the power consumption across the VM levels and between machines. Our experiments, based on CPU- and memory-intensive benchmarks running on different hardware setups, demonstrate that BitWatts scales both in number of monitored processes and virtualization levels. This non-invasive monitoring solution therefore paves the way for scalable energy accounting that takes into account the dynamic nature of virtualized environments.","2015","2023-07-10 14:37:29","2023-07-10 14:37:29","","","","","","","","","EuroSys '15","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Bordeaux, France","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, predicting the chaotic behavior of power systems in order to develop protection measures and keep power systems stable is vital. In this paper, a deep learning algorithm was proposed to predict the chaotic behavior of power systems by using deep long short-term memory (DLSTM) networks, which have two forms: deep long short-term memory with static scenario (DLSTM-s) and deep long-term memory with dynamic scenario (DLSTM-d). The genetic algorithm was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the networks. Then, taking interconnected power systems as an example, the effectiveness of the proposed DLSTM network was verified via numerical simulation. Finally, the experimental results of the DLSTM network were compared with those of the echo state network, multi-recurrent neural network, deep gated recurrent unit, and long short-term memory. Experimental results illustrated that a trained DLSTM network can predict the chaotic behavior of power systems by using the time series data of a single state variable. Moreover, the DLSTM-s network proposed in this paper can achieve competitive prediction performance compared with other baseline methods.","2022","2023-07-10 14:37:29","2023-07-10 14:37:29","","11–17","","","","","","","ICMLC 2022","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Guangzhou, China","","","","Chaos prediction; Deep learning; Deep long short-term memory; Power system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, various works have proposed machine learning–based methods for PDN power integrity prediction, many of which still suffer from large training overhead, inefficiency, or non-scalability. Thus, this article proposed an efficient and scalable framework for the worst-case power integrity prediction, which can handle general tasks including dynamic noise prediction and bump current prediction. The framework first reduces the spatial and temporal redundancy in the PDN and input current vector and then employs efficient feature extraction as well as a novel convolutional neural network architecture to predict the worst-case power integrity. Experimental results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the commercial tool and the state-of-the-art machine learning method with only 0.63–1.02% mean relative error and 25–69× speedup for noise prediction and 0.22–1.06% mean relative error and 24–64× speedup for bump current prediction.","2023-05","2023-07-10 14:37:29","2023-07-10 14:37:29","","","","4","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","bump current prediction; convolutional neural network; dynamic noise validation; Power distribution network; power integrity; sign-off","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To get a feeling of the possibilities and limitations of predictive maintenance for container-handling cranes, before investing time and money to collect operational data, we have used simulations to generate synthetic data for a few components of the cranes.

However, solutions to this problem, including static power models and canonical prediction models, either aim to build a static relationship between power consumption and hardware/application configurations without considering the dynamic fluctuation of power; or simply treat it as time series, ignoring the inherit power data characteristics. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we present a systematic power prediction framework based on extensive power dynamic profiling and deep learning models. In particular, we first analyse different power series samples to illustrate their noise patterns; accordingly we propose a power data de-noising method, which lowers noise interference to the modelling. With the pretreated data, we propose two deep learning based prediction models, including a fine-grained model and a coarse-grained model, which are suitable for different time scales. In the fine-grained prediction model, a recursive autoencoder (AE) is employed for short-duration prediction; in the coarse-grained model, an AE is used to encode massive fine-grained historical data as a further data pretreatment for long-duration prediction. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform canonical prediction methods with higher accuracy, up to 79% error reduction for certain cases.","2016","2023-07-10 14:37:29","2023-07-10 14:37:29","","","","","","","","","E2DC '16","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Waterloo, Ontario, Canada","","","","data centre; deep learning; power modelling; power prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the signoff ECO optimization is highly time-consuming, and the power improvement is hard to predict in advance. Ever since the industrial benchmarks released by the ISPD-2012 gate-sizing contest, active research has been conducted extensively to improve the optimization process. Nonetheless, previous works were mostly based on heuristics or analytical methods whose timing models were oversimplified and lacked of formal validations from commercial signoff tools. In this article, we propose ECO-graph neural networks (GNN), a transferable graph-learning-based framework, which harnesses GNNs to perform commercial-quality signoff power optimization through discrete (Vth-assignment. One of the highlights of our framework is that it generates tool-accurate optimization results instantly on unseen netlists that are not utilized in the training process. Furthermore, we propose a subgraph approximation technique to improve training and inferencing time of the proposed GNN model. We show that design instances with non-overlapping subgraphs can be optimized in parallel so as to improve the inference time of the learning-based model. Finally, we implement a GNN-based explanation method to interpret the optimization results achieved by our framework. Experimental results on 14 industrial designs, including a RISC-V-based multi-core system and the renowned ISPD-2012 benchmarks, demonstrate that our framework achieves up to 14× runtime improvement with similar signoff power optimization quality compared with Synopsys PrimeTime, an industry-leading signoff tool.","2023-05","2023-07-10 14:37:30","2023-07-10 14:37:30","","","","4","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Engineering Change Order (ECO); Graph Neural Networks (GNNs); power prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing solutions are often expensive, inaccurate, or unsuitable for long-term monitoring. In this work, we propose a new ammonia monitoring approach that is low-power, automatic, accurate, and wireless.Our system uses metal oxide sensors which change their electrical resistance due to an induced reduction reaction with ammonia at high temperatures. Traditional methods infer the ammonia level by measuring the sensor's electrical resistance after it reaches equilibrium. Such a system consumes a significant amount of energy because reaching equilibrium requires heating the sensor for minutes. Our proposed approach does not wait for equilibrium, but tries to predict the resistance at equilibrium using the sensor's initial resistance response curve in a very short heating pulse (as short as 200ms). The prediction model is built on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks.We built 38 prototype sensors and a home-grown gas flow system. In a 3-month in-lab testing period, we conducted extensive experiments and collected 13,770 measurements. Our model accurately predicts the equilibrium state resistance value, with an average error rate of 0.12%. The final average estimation error for the ammonia concentration level is 9.38ppm.

Bayesian-motivated minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-based noise PSD estimators have been the most prominent in recent time. However, they lack the ability to track highly non-stationary noise sources due to current methods of a priori signal-to-noise (SNR) estimation. This is caused by the underlying assumption that the noise signal changes at a slower rate than the speech signal. As a result, MMSE-based noise PSD trackers exhibit a large tracking delay and produce noise PSD estimates that require bias compensation. Motivated by this, we propose an MMSE-based noise PSD tracker that employs a temporal convolutional network (TCN) a priori SNR estimator. The proposed noise PSD tracker, called DeepMMSE makes no assumptions about the characteristics of the noise or the speech, exhibits no tracking delay, and produces an accurate estimate that requires no bias correction. Our extensive experimental investigation shows that the proposed DeepMMSE method outperforms state-of-the-art noise PSD trackers and demonstrates the ability to track abrupt changes in the noise level. Furthermore, when employed in a speech enhancement framework, the proposed DeepMMSE method is able to outperform state-of-the-art noise PSD trackers, as well as multiple deep learning approaches to speech enhancement.

A real-world situation like ""can a given 1000 compute node application be executed at a maximum of 2.7 GHz CPU frequency without going over the energy provider defined power band, or the available monthly energy limit?"" is just one example of the types of decisions HPC data centers will face. The previously developed Adaptive Energy and Power Consumption Prediction (AEPCP) model answers this question for the case of a fixed CPU frequency. This paper will extend the AEPCP process to enable the development of analytical models for estimating application execution time, power, and energy consumptions as functions of the number of compute nodes and maximum operating CPU frequency. Based on these analytical models, an adaptive model (Lightweight Adaptive Consumption Prediction (LACP)) is presented that implements the extended prediction process.

Here, we combined machine learning methods and energy scores of protein structures calculated by Rosetta Energy Function 2015 to predict SAV pathogenicity. The accuracy level of our model (0.76) is higher than that of six prediction tools. Further analyses revealed that the differential reference energies, attractive energies, and solvation of polar atoms between wildtype and mutant side-chains played essential roles in distinguishing benign from pathogenic variants.

However, harvested energy is intrinsically unstable. In order to overcome this drawback, non-volatile processors (NVPs) have been proposed to bridge intermittent program execution. However, even with NVPs, frequent power interruptions will severely degrade system performance. Hence, in this paper we adopt a multi-source in-door energy harvesting architecture to compensate the shortcoming of single energy source. We further investigate power harvesting prediction techniques, which are critical for NVP systems since they can coordinate with task scheduler in the NVP system to compensate the intermittent ambient energy harvesting. We investigate prediction methods both for single energy harvesting source and for multiple energy harvesting sources, the total output power of which is more stable compared with the single source case. A comprehensive evaluation framework has been developed using actually measured harvesting traces on the proposed neural network-based power harvesting prediction methods. It turns out that the most favorable prediction methods are directly predicting the total output power of DC-DC converters (connecting between energy sources and NVP), or predicting the total input power of DC-DC converters first and then inferring the total output power using a learned mapping function, for multi-source power harvesting predictions.","2016","2023-07-10 14:37:30","2023-07-10 14:37:30","","275–280","","","","","","","GLSVLSI '16","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Boston, Massachusetts, USA","","","","energy harvesting; multiple energy source; neural network; non-volatile processors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this system, a camera gimbal with the cameras was still controlled by a human operator from a long distance away. When the drone approached close to a steel tower, however, the camera gimbal was often unable to be controlled and real-time video transmission for the gimbal operator was sometimes interrupted due to radio-frequency interference from steel structure and energized power conductors. To solve such a control problem in the field, we also developed an auto-tracking camera gimbal that can automatically track and photograph power facilities on the basis of Deep Learning.

The proposed model takes into account processor power, bus activities, and system ambient temperature for real-time prediction on the power consumption of long running jobs. Using the HyperTransport and QuickPath Link structures as case studies and through electrical measurements on example server subsystems, we develop a chaotic time-series approximation for runtime power consumption, arriving at the Chaotic Attractor Predictor (CAP). With polynomial time complexity, CAP exhibits high prediction accuracy, having the prediction errors within 1.6% (or 3.3%) for servers based on the HyperTransport bus (or the QuickPath Links), as verified by a set of common processor benchmarks.

Because base stations (BSes) consume more than 70% of overall cellular network infrastructure energy, saving the power consumption of BSes is the key task to build a green cellular network. Except for low power design of the BS hardware and software, the traffic-driven BS sleeping operation is an economical way to improve existing cellular networks, which can reduce the BS power consumption at low traffic load. However, prior BS sleeping strategies establish on the static temporal characteristics of traffic load, which ignore the fact that network traffic is influenced by many factors such as time, human mobility, holiday, weather, etc. Hence, prior traffic estimation is coarse, and the BS sleeping strategies cannot apply to the changing network traffic. In this paper, we exploit a machine learning method to estimate the BS traffic and propose a BS sleeping strategy based on predicted traffic for power saving in the cellular network. We analyze network traffic in multi-views: temporal influence, spatial influence, and event influence. Then, we propose a multi-view ensemble learning model to predict network traffic load, which learns the traffic in multi-views and combine the results with ensemble. Furthermore, we formulate a BS sleeping strategy based on the predicted traffic load. Finally, we evaluate our traffic prediction algorithm on real cellular network data. The evaluation shows that our traffic prediction algorithm improves about 40% than state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Also, we evaluate the proposed BS sleeping strategy, which yields about 10% more energy savings and less device damage than the competitors in the simulated environment.","2017","2023-07-10 14:37:30","2023-07-10 14:37:30","","","","","","","","","SIGSPATIAL '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Redondo Beach, CA, USA","","","","Green Cellular Network; Multi-view Learning; Network Traffic Prediction; Smart City; Spatio-Temporal Data Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As energy harvesting is an attractive IoT power source, recent ReRAM-based CNN accelerators have been designed for operation on harvested energy. When addressing the instability problems of harvested energy, prior optimization techniques often assume that the load is fixed, overlooking the close interactions among input power, computational load, and circuit efficiency, or adapt the dynamic load to match the just-in-time incoming power under a simple harvesting architecture with no intermediate energy storage.Targeting a more efficient harvesting architecture equipped with both energy storage and energy delivery modules, this paper is the first effort to target whole system, end-to-end efficiency for an energy harvesting ReRAM-based accelerator. First, we model the relationships among ReRAM load power, DC-DC converter efficiency, and power failure overhead. Then, a maximum computation progress tracking scheme (MaxTracker) is proposed to achieve a joint optimization of the whole system by tuning the load power of the ReRAM-based accelerator. Specifically, MaxTracker accommodates both continuous and intermittent computing schemes and provides dynamic ReRAM load according to harvesting scenarios.We evaluate MaxTracker over four input power scenarios, and the experimental results show average speedups of 38.4%/40.3% (up to 51.3%/84.4%), over a full activation scheme (with energy storage) and order-of-magnitude speedups over the recently proposed (energy storage-less) ResiRCA technique. Furthermore, we also explore MaxTracker in combination with the Capybara reconfigurable capacitor approach to offer more flexible tuners and thus further boost the system performance.","2021-09","2023-07-10 14:37:30","2023-07-10 14:37:30","","","","5s","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","CNN; computing schemes; DC-DC efficiency; Energy harvesting; maximum computation progress; ReRAM crossbar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After that, a corresponding migrating instruction can be created eventually. Based on this instruction, the cloud orchestrator can suitably relocate virtual machines to a designed subset of infrastructure.

Some applications frequently work in screen-off state, heavily and consume battery. For saving power consumption in the state, accurate estimation of power consumption of each application is important. However, estimating power consumption cannot be easily achieved because of its dependency on device. That is, application's power consumption varies on installed application and type of hardware module in the device, which can be called software and hardware dependency, respectively. In this paper, we discuss estimation of power consumption in screen-off state considering software dependency. First, we explain software dependency of power consumption. Second, we propose a method, which takes account of software dependency, for estimating power consumption due to GPS. The proposed method monitors GPS utilization individually.

This has two main disadvantages. First, tasks may take longer to run as they may require multiple deployments before finally obtaining enough time on a resource to complete. Second, the wasted computation time will lead to wasted energy. We may be able to reduce the effect of the first disadvantage here by submitting multiple replicas of the task and take the results from the first one to complete.

Thus we desire to only ever submit the minimum number of replicas required to run the task in the allocated time whilst simultaneously minimising energy.

Server energy analysis and estimation must take all relevant factors into account to ensure reliable estimates and conclusions. Thorough system analysis requires benchmarks capable of testing different system resources at different load levels using multiple workload types. Server energy estimation approaches, on the other hand, require knowledge about the interactions of these factors for the creation of accurate power models. Common approaches to energy-aware workload classification categorize workloads depending on the resource types used by the different workloads. However, they rarely take into account differences in workloads targeting the same resources. Industrial energy-efficiency benchmarks typically do not evaluate the system's energy consumption at different resource load levels, and they only provide data for system analysis at maximum system load.In this paper, we benchmark multiple server configurations using the CPU worklets included in SPEC's Server Efficiency Rating Tool (SERT). We evaluate the impact of load levels and different CPU workloads on power consumption and energy efficiency. We analyze how functions approximating the measured power consumption differ over multiple server configurations and architectures. We show that workloads targeting the same resource can differ significantly in their power draw and energy efficiency. The power consumption of a given workload type varies depending on utilization, hardware and software configuration. The power consumption of CPU-intensive workloads does not scale uniformly with increased load, nor do hardware or software configuration changes affect it in a uniform manner.","2015","2023-07-10 14:37:31","2023-07-10 14:37:31","","223–234","","","","","","","ICPE '15","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Austin, Texas, USA","","","","energy efficiency; metrics; power; sert; spec; utilization; workload characterization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and file server. In case of a server node consisting of a single disk, CPU power generally exceeds disk-power consumption. However, file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power.

Our proposed solution is an adaptive power panel where different policies can be applied based on both of the nature of the tasks running on hosts, and the Cloud Provider decision.","2016","2023-07-10 14:37:31","2023-07-10 14:37:31","","9–14","","","","","","","AMECSE '16","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Cairo, Egypt","","","","Adaptive; Allocation; Cloudsim; Green Computing; Migration; Placement; Selection; Virtual Machine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As virtual machine located in data center are run under loaded to maintain higher performance but it causes wastage of resources and power.

The trade-off between efficient and ecologically sound operation represents a major challenge faced by many organizations at present. In addition, numerous companies are currently compelled to pay a carbon tax for the resources they use and the environmental impact of their products and services. Therefore, an energy consumption system can generate actual financial payback. Green information technology involves various approaches, including power management, recycling, telecommunications, and virtualization. This paper focuses on comparing and evaluating techniques used for reducing energy consumption in virtualized environments. We first highlight the impact of virtualization techniques on minimizing energy consumption in cloud computing. Then we present an experimental comparative study between two common energy-efficient task scheduling algorithms in cloud computing (i.e., the green scheduler, the power saver scheduler). These algorithms are discussed briefly and analyzed. The three metrics used to evaluate the task scheduling algorithms are (1) total power consumption, (2) data center load, and (3) virtual machine load.

We experimentally find that these variations cause marked fluctuations in clock speed and power consumption. Such a deceptively minor observation is overlooked in existing literature. Systems are thus designed and parameterized in overly conservative ways, missing on a number of optimizations.We rather demonstrate that it is possible to accurately model and concretely capitalize on these fluctuations. We derive an energy model as a function of supply voltage and prove its use in two settings. First, we develop EPIC, a compile-time energy analysis tool. We use it to substitute for the constant power assumption in existing analysis techniques, giving programmers accurate information on worst-case energy consumption of programs. When using EPIC with existing TPC system support, run-time energy efficiency drastically improves, eventually leading up to a 350% speedup in the time to complete a fixed workload. Further, when using EPIC with existing debugging tools, it avoids unnecessary program changes that hurt energy efficiency. Next, we extend the MSPsim emulator and explore its use in parameterizing a different TPC system support. The improvements in energy efficiency yield up to more than 1000% time speedup to complete a fixed workload.","2020-09","2023-07-10 14:37:31","2023-07-10 14:37:31","","","","6","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","energy modelling; intermittent computing; Transiently powered computers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a need for a near real-time power consumption modeling/monitoring system that could be used at scale within a Software Defined Data Center (SDDC). The power consumption models and information they provide can then be used to make better decisions for data center orchestration, e.g., whether to migrate virtual machines to reduce power consumption. We propose a scalable system that would 1) create initial power consumption models, as needed, for data center components, and 2) could be continually refined while the components are in use. The models will be used for the near real-time monitoring of power consumption, as well as predicting power consumption before and after potential orchestration decisions. The first step towards this goal of whole data center power modeling and prediction is to be able to predict the power consumption of one server effectively, based on high level utilization statistics from that server.

However, such systems are typically provisioned for mobile applications that have lower memory and I/O requirements than server application. Thus, the impact and extent of the imbalance between application and system resources in exploiting energy efficient execution of server workloads is unclear. This paper proposes a trace-driven analytical model for understanding the energy performance of server workloads on ARM Cortex-A9 multicore systems. Key to our approach is the modeling of the degrees of CPU core, memory and I/O resource overlap, and in estimating the number of cores and clock frequency that optimizes energy performance without compromising execution time. Since energy usage is the product of utilized power and execution time, the model first estimates the execution time of a program. CPU time, which accounts for both cores and memory response time, is modeled as an M/G/1 queuing system. Workload characterization of high performance computing, web hosting and financial computing applications shows that bursty memory traffic fits a Pareto distribution, and non-bursty memory traffic is exponentially distributed. Our analysis using these server workloads reveals that not all server workloads might benefit from higher number of cores or clock frequencies.

However, such systems are typically provisioned for mobile applications that have lower memory and I/O requirements than server application. Thus, the impact and extent of the imbalance between application and system resources in exploiting energy efficient execution of server workloads is unclear. This paper proposes a trace-driven analytical model for understanding the energy performance of server workloads on ARM Cortex-A9 multicore systems. Key to our approach is the modeling of the degrees of CPU core, memory and I/O resource overlap, and in estimating the number of cores and clock frequency that optimizes energy performance without compromising execution time. Since energy usage is the product of utilized power and execution time, the model first estimates the execution time of a program. CPU time, which accounts for both cores and memory response time, is modeled as an M/G/1 queuing system. Workload characterization of high performance computing, web hosting and financial computing applications shows that bursty memory traffic fits a Pareto distribution, and non-bursty memory traffic is exponentially distributed. Our analysis using these server workloads reveals that not all server workloads might benefit from higher number of cores or clock frequencies. Applying our model, we predict the configurations that increase energy efficiency by 10% without turning off cores, and up to one third with shutting down unutilized cores. For memory-bounded programs, we show that the limited memory bandwidth might increase both execution time and energy usage, to the point where energy cost might be higher than on a typical x64 multicore system.

The emergence of advanced technologies such as cloud-based services, internet of things (IoT), and big data analytics has augmented the growth of global data centers, leading to high energy consumption. This upsurge in energy consumption of the data centers not only incurs the issue of surging high cost (operational and maintenance) but also has an adverse effect on the environment. Dynamic power management in a data center environment requires the cognizance of the correlation between the system and hardware-level performance counters and the power consumption. Power consumption modeling exhibits this correlation and is crucial in designing energy-efficient optimization strategies based on resource utilization.

The rise of use cases of AI catered towards the Edge, where devices have limited computation power and storage capabilities, motivates the need for better understating of how AI performs and consumes energy. Goal. The aim of this paper is to empirically assess the impact of three different AI containerization strategies on the energy consumption, execution time, CPU, and memory usage for computer-vision tasks on the Edge. Method. In this paper we conduct an experiment with the used containerization strategy as main factor, with three treatments: ONNX Runtime, WebAssembly, and Docker. The subjects of the experiment are four widely-used computer-vision algorithms. We then orchestrate a series of runs where we deploy the four subjects on different generations of Raspberry Pi devices, with different hardware capabilities. A total of 120 runs (per device) are recorded to gather data on energy, execution time, CPU, and memory. Results. We found a statistically significant difference between the three containerization strategies on all dependent variables. Specifically, WebAssembly proves to be a valuable alternative for devices with reduced disk space and computation power. Conclusions. For computer-vision tasks with limited disk space and RAM memory requirements, developers should prefer WebAssembly for deployment.

For keeping performance defined in Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, it is important to estimate applications’ performance and power consumption after the fine-grained power capping is applied. We propose the estimation method of physical CPU usage when limiting virtual CPU usage of applications on VMs. On servers where multiple VMs run, VM’s usage of physical CPU is interrupted by the other VMs, and a hypervisor uses physical CPU to control VMs. These VMs’ and hypervisor’s behaviors make it difficult to estimate performance and power consumption by straightforward methods, such as linear regression and polynomial regression. The proposed method uses Piecewise Linear Regression to estimate physical CPU usage by assuming that VM’s access to physical CPU is not interrupted by the other VMs. Then we estimate how much physical CPU usage is reduced by the interruption. Because physical CPU usage is not stable soon after limiting CPU usage, the proposed method estimates a convergence value of CPU usage after many interruptions are repeated.","2017-08","2023-07-10 14:37:32","2023-07-10 14:37:32","","","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","piecewise linear regression; power consumption; response time; Server power capping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, there is a large body of work focusing on modelling the energy needs of this class of machine.This paper applies Grammatical Evolution (GE) for developing auto-regressive models for the energy consumption of a CNC machine. Empirical data from three 24-hour work shifts comprising three different types of products are used as inputs. We also introduce an autocorrelation-informed approach for the grammar, which benefits from a prior analysis of the training data for better capturing periodic or close to periodic behaviour. Finally, we compare the outcomes from real and predicted energy profiles through the use of an existing analysis tool, which is capable of extracting production-related information such as total and average KW consumption, number of parts produced and breakdown of production and idle hours. Results show that GE yields accurate and explainable models for the analysed scenario.","2021","2023-07-10 14:37:32","2023-07-10 14:37:32","","1557–1563","","","","","","","GECCO '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Lille, France","","","","CNC machines; energy consumption; grammatical evolution; real-world applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since sharp power variations across time steps cause power supply noises and degrade reliability of functional blocks, power variation is a design constraint in embedded systems. With the advent of high performance embedded systems and extensive deployment of fine grain clock-gating, reducing variations in power is becoming increasingly important.This paper studies how compilation techniques, more specifically instruction scheduling, can ameliorate variations in power due to functional units during program execution. By extending our previous work on rate-optimal software pipelining, this paper formulates the problem of constructing a performance-optimal schedule that minimizes power variations as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The formulation can be solved using an ILP solver. We applied our approach on <tt>SPEC NAS</tt> benchmarks to construct software pipelined schedules that have minimum power variations. The benchmarks are executed on the Wattch power simulator. In comparison to the original (power-unaware) scheduler implemented in the MIPSpro compiler, our power-aware approach generates schedules which have significantly lower power variations while maintaining the same performance. Such schedules have the potential to reduce hardware cost on power delivery in designing embedded systems.","2002","2023-07-10 14:37:33","2023-07-10 14:37:33","","210–217","","","","","","","CASES '02","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Grenoble, France","","","","instruction level parallelism; power-aware compilation; software pipelining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, energy costs are becoming an important factor during software development and evolution. However, there is still little support for creating energy-efficient software. In this work, we introduce a possible framework for software energy costs evaluation based on model analysis. We model software as Labelled Transitions Systems (LTS) and annotate these models with energy costs, which can be obtained using existing tools. We can then apply graph-based algorithms to traverse the models to obtain information about energy consumption related to software behaviour, such as its most/least costly execution, the cost of a specific execution, and the average cost of executing the software. No existing tool currently provides all the necessary analyses, even though they are essential for energy-consumption evaluation. We have conducted a small experiment with our framework where we employed jRAPL to measure energy costs. We annotated the models with the collected energy costs using an extended version of the LoTuS tool, where we have also implemented some of the desired analyses. Based on this support and on our initial results, we believe developers could create software more energy-efficient and consider possible trade-offs related to time, space, and energy costs when producing new versions of their systems.","2019","2023-07-10 14:37:33","2023-07-10 14:37:33","","67–72","","","","","","","SBES '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Salvador, Brazil","","","","Embedded Software; Energy Consumption Evaluation; Labelled Transition System; Model-based Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Migrating workload between various platforms is one way to improve both energy efficiency and performance. Effective migration decisions require accurate estimates of its costs and benefits. To date, these estimates were done by either instrumenting the source code/binaries, thus causing high overhead, or by using power estimates from hardware performance counters, which work well for individual machines, but until now have not been accurate for predicting across different architectures. In this paper, we propose P4, a new Phase-based Power and Performance Prediction framework which identifies cross-platform application power and performance at runtime for heterogeneous computing systems. P4 analyzes and detects machine-independent application phases by characterizing computing platforms offline with a set of benchmarks, and then builds neural network-based models to automatically identify and generalize the complex cross-platform relationships for each benchmark phase. It then leverages these models along with performance counter measurements collected at runtime to estimate performance and power consumption if it were running on a completely different computing platform, including a different CPU architecture, without ever having to run it on there. We evaluate the proposed framework on four commercial heterogeneous platforms, ranging from X86 servers to mobile ARM-based architecture, with 129 industry-standard benchmarks. Our experimental results show that P4 can predict the power and performance changes with only 6.8% and 5.6% error, respectively, even for completely different architectures from the ones applications ran on.","2017","2023-07-10 14:37:33","2023-07-10 14:37:33","","683–690","","","","","","","ICCAD '17","","","","IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","event-place: Irvine, California","","","","neural networks; performance prediction; phase recognition; power prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since data centres often install multiple NICs on each node, investigating and comparing them at the software level has high potential to enhance the energy efficiency of applications on Cloud infrastructures. We present a comparative analysis of the energy consumption of the software stack of two of today's most used NICs in data centres, Ethernet and Infiniband. We carefully design for this purpose a set of benchmark experiments to assess the impact of different traffic patterns and interface settings on energy consumption.

Because of this, the computing education field has developed a variety of approaches to designing and implementing these learning facilities. Yet, little work has gone into how to properly size cybersecurity laboratory infrastructure relative to student population and curricular compute power demands. The result has been laboratory infrastructures that do not scale with degree programs. Consequently, laboratories are either underpowered, thus limiting learning experiences, or overpowered which wastes financial resources. Accordingly, this work presents DRAT, an open-source software tool, for estimating necessary compute power in a cybersecurity engineering learning facility. More specifically, DRAT is designed to estimate the required discrete compute power on a per exercise basis in a cybersecurity engineering learning facility operating in a private cloud model. Such discrete estimations are intended to communicate physical host hardware requirements such as physical CPU core count, virtual RAM, and total Hard Disk space. The first step in designing DRAT was to forge a model estimator function. Then, we identified a series of scalar abstractions representing learning facility hardware infrastructure and behaving as conversion factors between the model function and output. Because the goal of this work was to provide estimates for cloud compute power requirements, DRAT outputs the number of physical cores, total RAM, total Disk, and total (virtual or physical) Network interfaces required to run the indicated scenario. The implication is that such estimates can inform purchasing and configuration decisions which directly impact student learning outcomes.","2021","2023-07-10 14:37:33","2023-07-10 14:37:33","","39","","","","","","","CEP '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Durham, United Kingdom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We exploit the machine learning techniques to aid the designers in exploring the design space of possible architectural solutions, and more specifically, their dynamic power consumption, which is application-, technology-, frequency-, and data-stimuli dependent. To model the power and the behavior of digital components, we adopt the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while the final target technology is Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The main characteristic of the proposed method, called NeuPow, is that it relies on propagating the signals throughout connected ANN models to predict the power consumption of a composite system. Besides a baseline version of the NeuPow methodology that works for a given predefined operating frequency, we also derive an upgraded version that is frequency-aware, where the same operating frequency is taken as additional input by the ANN models. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we perform different assessments at different levels. Moreover, technology and scalability studies have been conducted, proving the NeuPow robustness in terms of these design parameters. Results show a very good estimation accuracy with less than 9% of relative error independently from the technology and the size/layers of the design. NeuPow is also delivering a speed-up factor of about 84× with respect to the classical power estimation flow.","2020-08","2023-07-10 14:37:33","2023-07-10 14:37:33","","","","5","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","estimation; methodology; modeling; neural networks; Power consumption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Suggested techniques for activity monitoring face two major problem. First, systems have to be trained for the individual subjects due to the heterogeneity of the BSN data. While most solutions can address this problem on a small data set, they have no mechanics for automatic scaling of the solution as the data set increases. Second, the battery limitations of the BSN severely limit the maximum deployment time for the continuous monitoring. This problem is often solved by shifting some processing to the local sensor nodes to avoid a very heavy communication cost. However, little work has been done to optimize the sensing and processing cost of the action recognition. In this paper, we propose an action recognition approach based on the BSN repository. We show how the information of a large repository can be automatically used to customize the processing on sensor nodes based on a limited and automated training process.

An excessive amount of heat creates reliability problems, reduces the lifetime of a processor, and elevates the cost of cooling and packaging considerably. It is therefore imperative to be able to monitor the temperature variations across the die in a timely and accurate manner.Most current techniques rely on on-chip thermal sensors to report the temperature of the processor. Unfortunately, significant variation in chip temperature both spatially and temporally exposes the limitation of the sensors. We present a compensating approach to tracking chip temperature through an OS resident software module that generates live power and thermal profiles of the processor. We developed such a software thermal sensor (STS) in a Linux system with a Pentium 4 Northwood core. We employed highly efficient numerical methods in our model to minimize the overhead of temperature calculation. We also developed an efficient algorithm for functional unit power modeling. Our power and thermal models are calibrated and validated against on-chip sensor readings, thermal images of the Northwood heat spreader, and the thermometer measurements on the package. The resulting STS offers detailed power and temperature breakdowns of each functional unit at runtime, enabling more efficient online power and thermal monitoring and management at a higher level, such as the operating system.","2008-05","2023-07-10 14:37:34","2023-07-10 14:37:34","","","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Power; thermal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software developers as the builders and maintainers of applications, are responsible for updating and deploying energy efficient applications to end users. Unfortunately, the impact of software change on energy consumption is still unclear. Estimation based on software metrics has proved difficult. As energy consumption profiling requires special infrastructure, developers have difficulty assessing the impact of their actions on energy consumption. System calls are the interface between applications and the OS kernel and provide insight into how software utilizes hardware and software resources. As profiling system calls requires no specialized infrastructure, unlike energy consumption, it is much easier for the developers to track changes to system calls. Thus we relate software change to energy consumption by tracing the changes in an application's pattern of system call invocations.

Therefore, automatic approaches for power, performance, and memory estimations are needed.In this paper, we present a novel approach, enabling designers to fast and accurately estimate the power consumption of CNNs inferencing on GPGPUs with Dynamic Frequency Scaling(DFS) in the early stages of the design process. The proposed approach uses static analysis for feature extraction and Random Forest Tree regression analysis for predictive model generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can predict the CNNs power consumption with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of 5.03% compared to the actual hardware.","2022","2023-07-10 14:37:34","2023-07-10 14:37:34","","103–109","","","","","","","MLCAD '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, China","","","","CNN; GPGPU; machine learning; neural hardware search; power estimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The improved performance and high energy efficiency of micro servers have driven both academia and industry to explore the possibility of replacing conventional brawny servers with a larger swarm of embedded micro servers. Existing attempts mostly focus on mobile-class micro servers, whose capacities are similar to mobile phones. We, on the other hand, target on sensor-class micro servers, which are originally intended for uses in wearable technologies, sensor networks, and Internet-of-Things. Although sensor-class micro servers have much less capacity, they are touted for minimal power consumption (&lt; 1 Watt), which opens new possibilities of achieving higher energy efficiency in datacenter workloads. Our systematic evaluation of the Edison cluster and comparisons to conventional brawny clusters involve careful workload choosing and laborious parameter tuning, which ensures maximum server utilization and thus fair comparisons. Results show that the Edison cluster achieves up to 3.5x improvement on work-done-per-joule for web service applications and data-intensive MapReduce jobs. In terms of scalability, the Edison cluster scales linearly on the throughput of web service workloads, and also shows satisfactory scalability for MapReduce workloads despite coordination overhead.","2016-05","2023-07-10 14:37:34","2023-07-10 14:37:34","","696–707","","9","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: VLDB Endowment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Often motivated by optimization objectives, software products are characterized by different subsequent releases and deployed through different strategies. The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products.Aims. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure.Method. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption.Results. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency.Conclusions. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered. The number of machines involved in a software deployment strategy does not simply constitute an additive effect of the energy consumption of the underlying hardware infrastructure.","2017","2023-07-10 14:37:35","2023-07-10 14:37:35","","257–266","","","","","","","ESEM '17","","","","IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","event-place: Markham, Ontario, Canada","","","","deployment; energy; software releases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, block ciphers are difficult to implement efficiently on embedded devices like cell phones or sensor nodes where run-time memory and program ROM are scarce resources. In this paper we analyze and compare the performance, energy consumption, run-time memory requirements, and code size of the five block ciphers RC6, Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish, and XTEA on the StrongARM SA-1100 processor. Most previous evaluations of block ciphers considered performance as the sole metric of interest and did not care about memory requirements or code size. In contrast to previous work, our study of the performance and energy characteristics of block ciphers has been conducted with ""lightweight"" implementations which restrict the size of lookup tables to 1 kB and also impose constraints on the code size. We found that Rijndael and RC6 can be well optimized for high performance and energy efficiency, while at the same time meeting the demand for low memory (RAM and ROM) footprint. In addition, we discuss the impact of key expansion and modes of operation on the overall performance and energy consumption of each block cipher. Our simulation results show that RC6 is the most energy-efficient block cipher under memory constraints and thus the best choice for resource-restricted devices.","2007","2023-07-10 14:37:35","2023-07-10 14:37:35","","1110–1115","","","","","","","DATE '07","","","","EDA Consortium","San Jose, CA, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Nice, France","","","","code size reduction; energy optimization; lightweight cryptography; memory footprint; symmetric cipher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This feature was discovered and reported in 2005. In this paper, based on a measurement of 15 open-source Java programs, we show that when software systems are modeled as a series of dynamic Call Graphs during their executions, they always obey DPL with very close correlation. Then a comparison between static Call Graph and DPL is presented, showing that DPL's properties cannot be derived statically. An explanation for DPL of software execution is given and verified.

Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software running within emulators or virtual machines. Some prior models require actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application.In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications.

Competing potential values we may want to choose from are, at their core, made up of disagreements between individual people. But while the raw datasets that most ML systems rely on are made up of individuals, today’s approaches to building AI typically abstract the individuals out of the pipeline. My thesis contributes a set of algorithms and interactive systems that re-imagine the pipeline for designing and evaluating AI systems, requiring that we deal with competing values in an informed and intentional way. I start from the insight that at each stage of the pipeline, we need to treat individuals as the key unit of operation, rather than the abstractions or aggregated pseudo-humans in use by today’s approaches. I instantiate this insight to address two problems that arise from today’s AI pipeline. First, evaluation metrics produce actively misleading scores about the extent to which some people’s values are being reflected. I introduce a mathematical transformation that more closely aligns metrics with the values and methods of user-facing performance measures. Second, the resulting AI systems either surreptitiously choose which values to listen to without input from users, or simply present several different outcomes to users without mechanisms to help them select an outcome grounded in their values. I propose a new interaction paradigm for deploying classifiers, asking users to compose a jury consisting of the individual people they’d like their classifiers’ decisions to come from.","2021","2023-07-10 14:37:35","2023-07-10 14:37:35","","171–174","","","","","","","UIST '21 Adjunct","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Earlier research has proposed many high-level/source-level estimation modeling works, particularly for basic blocks. However, most of them still need to execute the target software at least once on a fine-grained simulator or real hardware to extract required features. This paper proposes a performance/power prediction framework, called Deep Power Meter (DeepPM), which estimates them accurately only using the compiled binary. Inspired by the deep learning techniques in natural language processing, we convert the program instructions in the form of vectors and predict the average power and performance of basic blocks based on a transformer model. In addition, unlike existing works based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model structure, which only works for basic blocks with a small number of instructions, DeepPM provides highly accurate results for long basic blocks, which takes the majority of the execution time for actual application runs. In our evaluation conducted with SPEC2006 benchmark suite, we show that DeepPM can provide accurate prediction for performance and power consumption with 10.2% and 12.3% error, respectively. DeepPM also outperforms the LSTM-based model by up to 67.2% and 34.9% error for performance and power, respectively.","2022","2023-07-10 14:37:35","2023-07-10 14:37:35","","1491–1496","","","","","","","DATE '22","","","","European Design and Automation Association","Leuven, BEL","","","","","","","","event-place: Antwerp, Belgium","","","","power and performance modeling; system resource prediction; transformer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various approximate methods have been proposed in the literature that demonstrate the effectiveness of relaxing accuracy requirements in a specific unit. This provides a basis for exploring simultaneous use of multiple approximate units to improve efficiency under guarantees on quality of results. In this paper, we explore the effect of combining multiple approximate units on the energy consumption and identify the best setting that minimizes energy consumption under a quality constraint. Our approach also enables changes in unit configurations throughout the program. To do this effectively, we need a method to examine the combined impact of multiple approximate units on the output quality, and configure individual units accordingly. To solve this problem, we propose LEMAX that uses gradient descent approach to identify the best configuration of the individual approximate units for a given program. We evaluate the efficacy of LEMAX in minimizing the energy consumption of several machine learning applications with varying size (i.e., number of operations) under different quality constraints.

The goal is to provide developers with techniques and tools to reason about the energy consumption of all products in a SPL, without having to produce, run and measure the energy in all of them.Our technique combines static program analysis techniques and worst case execution time prediction with energy consumption analysis. This technique analyzes all products in a feature-sensitive manner, that is, a feature used in several products is analyzed only once, while the energy consumption is estimated once per product.We implemented our technique in a tool called Serapis. We did a preliminary evaluation using a product line for image processing implemented in C. Our experiments considered 7 products from such line and our initial results show that the tool was able to estimate the worst-case energy consumption with a mean error percentage of 9.4% and standard deviation of 6.2% when compared with the energy measured when running the products.","2017","2023-07-10 14:37:35","2023-07-10 14:37:35","","84–93","","","","","","","SPLC '17","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Sevilla, Spain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The threat of reducing a customer's battery-life now hangs over the software developer who asks, ""will this next change be the one that causes my software to drain a customer's battery?"" One solution is to detect power consumption regressions by measuring the power usage of tests, but this is time-consuming and often noisy. An alternative is to rely on software metrics that allow us to estimate the impact that a change might have on power consumption thus relieving the developer from expensive testing. This paper presents a general methodology for investigating the impact of software change on power consumption, we relate power consumption to software changes, and then investigate the impact of static OO software metrics on power consumption. We demonstrated that software change can effect power consumption using the Firefox web-browser and the Azureus/Vuze BitTorrent client. We found evidence of a potential relationship between some software metrics and power consumption. In conclusion, we explored the effect of software change on power consumption on two projects; and we provide an initial investigation on the impact of software metrics on power consumption.","2012","2023-07-10 14:37:35","2023-07-10 14:37:35","","78–87","","","","","","","MSR '12","","","","IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","event-place: Zurich, Switzerland","","","","dynamic analysis; mining software repositories; power; power consumption; software metrics; sustainable-software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A major limitation for each of these proposals is that they are tied to a specific benchmark, and hence, they provide limited insight with respect to why one system may be more energy-efficient than another.This paper proposes SWEEP, Synthetic Workloads for Energy Efficiency and Performance evaluation, a framework for generating synthetic workloads with specific behavioral characteristics. We employ SWEEP to generate a wide range of synthetic workloads while varying the instruction mix, ILP, memory access patterns, and I/O-intensiveness; and we use SWEEP to evaluate the energy efficiency of commercial computer systems across the workload space and learn about how the energy efficiency of a computer system is tied to its workload's characteristics.This paper also presents the Energy-Delay Diagram (EDD), a novel method for visualizing energy efficiency.

In particular, monitoring and analyzing the power consumption of a distributed system spanning several—potentially heterogeneous—nodes becomes particularly tedious when aiming at a finer granularity than observing the power consumption of hosting nodes. While the state-of-the-art in software-defined power meters fails to deliver adaptive solutions to offer such service-level perspective and to cope with the diversity of hardware CPU architectures, this paper proposes to automatically learn the power models of the nodes supporting a distributed system, and then to use these inferred power models to better understand how the power consumption of the system's processes is distributed across nodes at runtime.Our solution, named WattsKit, offers a modular toolkit to build software-defined power meters ""à la carte"", thus dealing with the diversity of user and hardware requirements. Beyond the demonstrated capability of covering a wide diversity of CPU architectures with high accuracy, we illustrate the benefits of adopting software-defined power meters to analyze the power consumption of complex layered and distributed systems. In particular, we illustrate the capability of our approach to monitor the power consumption of a system composed of Docker Swarm, Weave,Elasticsearch, and Apache ZooKeeper.
