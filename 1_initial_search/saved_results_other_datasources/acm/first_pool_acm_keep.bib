abstract = {In this paper, we examine the energy consumption of a state-of-the-art pocket computer. Using a data acquisition system, we measure the energy consumption of the Itsy Pocket Computer, developed by Compaq Computer Corporation's Palo Alto Research Labs. We begin by showing that the energy usage characteristics of the Itsy differ markedly from that of a notebook computer. Then, since we expect that flexible software environments will become increasingly prevalent on pocket computers, we consider applications running in a Java environment. In particular, we explain some of the Java design tradeoffs applicable to pocket computers, and quantify their energy costs. For the design options we considered and the three workloads we studied, we find a maximum change in energy use of 25%.},

abstract = {Sustainable software engineering has received a lot of attention in recent times, as we witness an ever-growing slice of energy use, for example, at data centers, as software systems utilize the underlying infrastructure. Characterizing servers for their energy use accurately without being intrusive, is therefore important to make sustainable software deployment choices. In this paper, we introduce ESAVE which is a machine learning-based approach that leverages a small set of hardware attributes to characterize a server or virtual machine’s energy usage across different levels of utilization. This is based upon an extensive exploration of multiple ML approaches, with a focus on a minimal set of required attributes, while showcasing good accuracy. Early validations show that ESAVE has only around 12% average prediction error, despite being non-intrusive.},

Understanding the relationship between GPU power consumption and program features can aid developers in building energy-efficient sustainable applications. In this work, we propose a static analysis based power model built using machine learning techniques. We have investigated six machine learning models across three NVIDIA GPU architectures: Kepler, Maxwell, and Volta with Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, and XGBoost, reporting favorable results. We observed that the XGBoost technique based prediction model is the most efficient technique with an R-square value of 0.9646 on Volta Architecture. The dataset used for these techniques includes kernels from different benchmarks suits, sizes, nature (e.g., compute-bound, memory-bound), and complexity (e.g., control divergence, memory access patterns). Experimental results suggest that the proposed solution can help developers precisely predict GPU applications power consumption using program analysis across GPU architectures. Developers can use this approach to refactor their code to build energy-efficient GPU applications.},

abstract = {Power estimation of software processes provides critical indicators to drive scheduling or power capping heuristics. State-of-the-art solutions can perform coarse-grained power estimation in virtualized environments, typically treating virtual machines (VMs) as a black box. Yet, VM-based systems are nowadays commonly used to host multiple applications for cost savings and better use of energy by sharing common resources and assets.In this paper, we propose a fine-grained monitoring middleware providing real-time and accurate power estimation of software processes running at any level of virtualization in a system. In particular, our solution automatically learns an application-agnostic power model, which can be used to estimate the power consumption of applications.Our middleware implementation, named BitWatts, builds on a distributed actor implementation to collect process usage and infer fine-grained power consumption without imposing any hardware investment (e.g., power meters). BitWatts instances use high-throughput communication channels to spread the power consumption across the VM levels and between machines. Our experiments, based on CPU- and memory-intensive benchmarks running on different hardware setups, demonstrate that BitWatts scales both in number of monitored processes and virtualization levels. This non-invasive monitoring solution therefore paves the way for scalable energy accounting that takes into account the dynamic nature of virtualized environments.},

abstract = {Power integrity analysis is an essential step in power distribution network (PDN) sign-off to ensure the performance and reliability of chips. However, with the growing PDN size and increasing scenarios to be validated, it becomes very time- and resource-consuming to conduct full-stack PDN simulation to check the power integrity for different test vectors. Recently, various works have proposed machine learning–based methods for PDN power integrity prediction, many of which still suffer from large training overhead, inefficiency, or non-scalability. Thus, this article proposed an efficient and scalable framework for the worst-case power integrity prediction, which can handle general tasks including dynamic noise prediction and bump current prediction. The framework first reduces the spatial and temporal redundancy in the PDN and input current vector and then employs efficient feature extraction as well as a novel convolutional neural network architecture to predict the worst-case power integrity. Experimental results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the commercial tool and the state-of-the-art machine learning method with only 0.63–1.02% mean relative error and 25–69\texttimes{} speedup for noise prediction and 0.22–1.06% mean relative error and 24–64\texttimes{} speedup for bump current prediction.},

abstract = {Wireless communication networks are subject to various types of adversarial attacks, which might be passive in the form of eavesdropping, or active in the form of jamming. For the former category, even if the traffic is encrypted, an adversary performing analysis on observed traffic signatures may lead to leakage of the so called contextual information regarding the traffic. New advances in the field of machine learning also result in significantly more complex adversarial units, which may deduce different forms and uses of such contextual information. In this work, we are interested in power adaptation against an intelligent adversary which utilizes deep learning and attempts to perform predictions and time forecasting on the observed traffic traces to estimate the imminent traffic intensities. Based on its traffic predictions, the adversary might possibly activate its jamming mode and utilize its limited power more efficiently to inflict maximal damage. As a method of mitigation, the transmitter may want to increase transmitter power if it expects a higher probability of jamming, and it has a significant amount of upcoming data to transmit. We leverage Lyapunov optimization and virtual queues to meet a certain level of data transmission reliability while also minimizing power consumption.},

The application of predictive maintenance requires historical data collection and preprocessing of equipment sensor and maintenance data. To get a feeling of the possibilities and limitations of predictive maintenance for container-handling cranes, before investing time and money to collect operational data, we have used simulations to generate synthetic data for a few components of the cranes. Using the simulated crane data, a prediction model was trained to predict upcoming component failures.

As the emerging field of machine learning, deep learning shows excellent ability in solving complex learning problems. In this paper, we designed a deep learning prediction process based on low-power heterogeneous multi core architecture. Firstly, the fundamental principle of image recognition method based on deep learning reviewed as the basis of the research. Secondly, a set of key algorithm design to parallel access and process image for object detection based on Parallella multi core platform was proposed to improve the detection speed and the computational resource efficiency on single node.

abstract = {Modelling and analyzing power consumption for data centres can diagnose potential energy-hungry components and applications, and facilitate in-time control, benefiting the energy efficiency of data centers. However, solutions to this problem, including static power models and canonical prediction models, either aim to build a static relationship between power consumption and hardware/application configurations without considering the dynamic fluctuation of power; or simply treat it as time series, ignoring the inherit power data characteristics. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we present a systematic power prediction framework based on extensive power dynamic profiling and deep learning models. In particular, we first analyse different power series samples to illustrate their noise patterns; accordingly we propose a power data de-noising method, which lowers noise interference to the modelling. With the pretreated data, we propose two deep learning based prediction models, including a fine-grained model and a coarse-grained model, which are suitable for different time scales. In the fine-grained prediction model, a recursive autoencoder (AE) is employed for short-duration prediction; in the coarse-grained model, an AE is used to encode massive fine-grained historical data as a further data pretreatment for long-duration prediction. Experimental results show that our proposed models outperform canonical prediction methods with higher accuracy, up to 79% error reduction for certain cases.},

abstract = {Modern electronic design automation flows depend on both implementation and signoff tools to perform timing-constrained power optimization through Engineering Change Orders (ECOs), which involve gate sizing and threshold-voltage (Vth)-assignment of standard cells. However, the signoff ECO optimization is highly time-consuming, and the power improvement is hard to predict in advance. Ever since the industrial benchmarks released by the ISPD-2012 gate-sizing contest, active research has been conducted extensively to improve the optimization process. Nonetheless, previous works were mostly based on heuristics or analytical methods whose timing models were oversimplified and lacked of formal validations from commercial signoff tools. In this article, we propose ECO-graph neural networks (GNN), a transferable graph-learning-based framework, which harnesses GNNs to perform commercial-quality signoff power optimization through discrete (Vth-assignment. One of the highlights of our framework is that it generates tool-accurate optimization results instantly on unseen netlists that are not utilized in the training process. Furthermore, we propose a subgraph approximation technique to improve training and inferencing time of the proposed GNN model. We show that design instances with non-overlapping subgraphs can be optimized in parallel so as to improve the inference time of the learning-based model. Finally, we implement a GNN-based explanation method to interpret the optimization results achieved by our framework. Experimental results on 14 industrial designs, including a RISC-V-based multi-core system and the renowned ISPD-2012 benchmarks, demonstrate that our framework achieves up to 14\texttimes{} runtime improvement with similar signoff power optimization quality compared with Synopsys PrimeTime, an industry-leading signoff tool.},

Embedded processors that satisfy the hunger for superlative processing power share a common issue: the increasing performance leads to growing energy demands during operation. As energy remains a limited resource to embedded devices, it is critical to optimise software components for low power. Low-power software needs energy models which, however, are increasingly difficult to create as to the complexity of today's devices.In this paper we present a black-box approach to construct precise energy models for complex hardware devices. We apply machine-learning techniques in combination with fully automatic energy measurements and evaluate our approach with an ARM Cortex platform. We show that our system estimates the energy demand of program code with a mean percentage error of 1.8% compared to the results of energy measurements.},

abstract = {Accurate and continuous ammonia monitoring is important for laboratory animal studies and many other applications. Existing solutions are often expensive, inaccurate, or unsuitable for long-term monitoring. In this work, we propose a new ammonia monitoring approach that is low-power, automatic, accurate, and wireless.Our system uses metal oxide sensors which change their electrical resistance due to an induced reduction reaction with ammonia at high temperatures. Traditional methods infer the ammonia level by measuring the sensor's electrical resistance after it reaches equilibrium. Such a system consumes a significant amount of energy because reaching equilibrium requires heating the sensor for minutes. Our proposed approach does not wait for equilibrium, but tries to predict the resistance at equilibrium using the sensor's initial resistance response curve in a very short heating pulse (as short as 200ms). The prediction model is built on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks.We built 38 prototype sensors and a home-grown gas flow system. In a 3-month in-lab testing period, we conducted extensive experiments and collected 13,770 measurements. Our model accurately predicts the equilibrium state resistance value, with an average error rate of 0.12%. The final average estimation error for the ammonia concentration level is 9.38ppm. Given the ultra low power consumption and accurate measurements, we have partnered with cage vendors and deployed our system at two animal research facilities (NIH and Cornell University) for month-long medical trials.},

abstract = {Distance estimation and proximity classification techniques are essential for numerous IoT applications and in providing efficient services in smart cities. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is designed for IoT devices, and its received signal strength indicator (RSSI) has been used in distance and proximity estimation, though they are noisy and unreliable. In this study, we leverage the BLE TX power level in BLE models.We adopt a comparative analysis framework that utilizes our extensive data library of measurements. It considers commonly used state-of-the-art model, in addition to our data-driven proposed approach. The RSSI and TX power are integrated into several parametric models such as log shadowing and Android Beacon library models, and machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests and neural networks. Specific mobile apps are developed for the study experiment. We have collected more than 1.8 millions of BLE records between encounters with various distances that range from 0.5 to 22 meters in an indoor environment. Interestingly, considering TX power when estimating the distance reduced the mean errors by up to 46% in parametric models and by up to 35% in machine learning models. Also, the proximity classification accuracy increased by up to 103% and 70% in parametric and machine learning models, respectively. This work is one of the first studies (if not the first) that analyze in depth the TX power variations in improving the distance estimation and classification.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of virtualization and cloud comput- ing, optimizing the power usage effectiveness of enterprise data centers has become a laudable goal and a critical re- quirement in IT operations all over the world. While a sig- nificant body of research exists to measure, monitor, and control the greenness level of hardware components, signif- icant research efforts are needed to relate hardware energy consumption to energy consumption due to program exe- cution. In this paper we report on our investigations to characterize power consumption profiles for different types of compute and memory intensive software applications. In particular, we focus on studying the effects of CPU loads on the power consumption of compute servers by monitoring rack power consumption in a data center. We conducted a series of experiments with a variety of processes of differ- ent complexity to understand and characterize the effect on power consumption. Combining processes of varying com- plexity with varying resource allocations produces different energy consumption levels. The challenge is to optimize pro- cess orchestration based on a power consumption framework to accrue energy savings. Our ultimate goal is to develop smart adaptive green computing techniques, such as adap- tive job scheduling and resource provisioning, to reduce over- all power consumption in data centers or clouds.},

In this paper, we propose a methodology to capture the behaviour of most relevant energy-related ICT resources in data centres and present a generic model for them.

Furthermore, unlike the state-of-the-art approaches, we provide detailed power consumption models at server and storage levels. We evaluate our model for different types of servers and show that it suffers from an error rate of 2% in the best case, and less than 10% in the worst case.},

abstract = {Data center providers and server operators try to reduce the power consumption of their servers. Finding an energy efficient server for a specific target application is a first step in this regard. Estimating the power consumption of an application on an unavailable server is difficult, as nameplate power values are generally overestimations. Offline power models are able to predict the consumption accurately, but are usually intended for system design, requiring very specific and detailed knowledge about the system under consideration.In this paper, we introduce an offline power prediction method that uses the results of standard power rating tools. The method predicts the power consumption of a specific application for multiple load levels on a target server that is otherwise unavailable for testing. We evaluate our approach by predicting the power consumption of three applications on different physical servers. Our method is able to achieve an average prediction error of 9.49% for three workloads running on real-world, physical servers.},

abstract = {When deploying Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) onto multi-core embedded platforms, an intensive evaluation flow is necessary to find implementations that optimize resource usage, timing and power. ANNs require indeed significant amounts of computational and memory resources to execute, while embedded execution platforms offer limited resources with strict power budget. Concurrent accesses from processors to shared resources on multi-core platforms can lead to bottlenecks with impact on performance and power. Existing approaches show limitations to deliver fast yet accurate evaluation ahead of ANN deployment on the targeted hardware. In this paper, we present a modeling flow for timing and power prediction in early design stage of fully-connected ANNs on multi-core platforms. Our flow offers fast yet accurate predictions with consideration of shared communication resources and scalability in regards of the number of cores used. The flow is evaluated on real measurements for 42 mappings of 3 fully-connected ANNs executed on a clock-gated multi-core platform featuring two different communication modes: polling or interrupt-based. Our modeling flow predicts timing with accuracy and power with accuracy on the tested mappings for an average simulation time of 0.23 s for 100 iterations. We then illustrate the application of our approach for efficient design space exploration of ANN implementations.},

abstract = {Edge servers must routinely undergo maintenance to ensure the environment's performance and security. During maintenance, applications hosted by outdated servers must be relocated to alternative servers to avoid downtime. In distributed edges with servers spread across large regions, ensuring that applications are not migrated to servers too far away from their users to avoid high latency hardens the maintenance planning. In addition, the limited power supply of edge sites restricts the list of suitable alternative hosts for the applications even further. Past work has focused on optimizing maintenance or increasing the power efficiency of edge computing infrastructures. However, no work addresses both objectives together. This paper presents Emma, a maintenance strategy that reduces power consumption during edge server maintenance without excessively extending maintenance time or increasing application latency. Experiments show that Emma can minimize power consumption during maintenance by up to 26.48% compared to strategies from the literature.},

abstract = {This article proposes a runtime model that relates server energy consumption to its overall thermal envelope, using hardware performance counters and experimental measurements. While previous studies have attempted system-wide modeling of server power consumption through subsystem models, our approach is different in that it links system energy input to subsystem energy consumption based on a small set of tightly correlated parameters. The proposed model takes into account processor power, bus activities, and system ambient temperature for real-time prediction on the power consumption of long running jobs. Using the HyperTransport and QuickPath Link structures as case studies and through electrical measurements on example server subsystems, we develop a chaotic time-series approximation for runtime power consumption, arriving at the Chaotic Attractor Predictor (CAP). With polynomial time complexity, CAP exhibits high prediction accuracy, having the prediction errors within 1.6% (or 3.3%) for servers based on the HyperTransport bus (or the QuickPath Links), as verified by a set of common processor benchmarks. Our CAP is a superior predictive mechanism over existing linear auto-regressive methods, which require expensive and complex corrective steps to address the nonlinear and chaotic aspects of the underlying physical system.},

abstract = {The environmental impact of servers and datacenters is an important future challenge. System architects have traditionally focused on operational energy as a proxy for designing green servers, but this ignores important environmental implications from server production (materials, manufacturing, etc.). In contrast, this paper argues for a lifecycle focus on the environmental impact of future server designs, to include both operation and production. We present a new methodology to quantify the total environmental impact of system design decisions. Our approach uses the thermodynamic metric of exergy consumption, adapted and validated for use by system architects. Using this methodology, we evaluate the lifecycle impact of several example system designs with environment-friendly optimizations. Our results show that environmental impact from production can be important (around 20% on current servers and growing) and system design choices can reduce this component (by 30--40%). Our results also highlight several, sometimes unexpected, cross-interactions between the environmental impact of production and operation that further motivate a total lifecycle emphasis for future green server designs.},

abstract = {Due to the budget and the environmental issues, achieving energy efficiency gradually receives a lot of attentions these days. In our previous research, a prediction technique has been developed to improve the monitoring statistics. In this research, by adopting the predictive monitoring information, our new proposal can perform the optimization to solve the energy issue of cloud computing. Actually, the optimization technique, which is convex optimization, is coupled with the proposed prediction method to produce a near-optimal set of hosting physical machines. After that, a corresponding migrating instruction can be created eventually. Based on this instruction, the cloud orchestrator can suitably relocate virtual machines to a designed subset of infrastructure. Subsequently, the idle physical servers can be turned off in an appropriate manner to save the power as well as maintain the system performance. For the purpose of evaluation, an experiment is conducted based on 29-day period of Google traces. By utilizing this evaluation, the proposed approach shows the potential to significantly reduce the power consumption without affecting the quality of services.},

The main objective is to increase the sum-rate of the mobile network in the introduced beamforming and mmWave channel environment.Simulation results show up to a $20%$ sum-rate average performance increase of the system using the ANN management in contrast to a random non-ANN managed system. The Leveberg-Marquard (L-M) training algorithm is the best overall algorithm for this proposed application as presents the highest accuracy of around $77%$ despite 37 minutes of training and lower accuracy of $73%$ with approximately 28 seconds of training time.},

abstract = {Android operating system has become one of the most popular smartphone platforms. One report stated that the most important issue of smartphones was its power consumption. Android has a function with which an application can be invoked in screen-off state without user's operation. Some applications frequently work in screen-off state, heavily and consume battery. For saving power consumption in the state, accurate estimation of power consumption of each application is important. However, estimating power consumption cannot be easily achieved because of its dependency on device. That is, application's power consumption varies on installed application and type of hardware module in the device, which can be called software and hardware dependency, respectively. In this paper, we discuss estimation of power consumption in screen-off state considering software dependency. First, we explain software dependency of power consumption. Second, we propose a method, which takes account of software dependency, for estimating power consumption due to GPS. The proposed method monitors GPS utilization individually. Third, we evaluate our method with a benchmark and practical applications using GPS. We then demonstrate that our method can estimate power consumption of each application and suitably predict consumption after uninstalling an application without uninstallation.},

abstract = {High Throughput Computing allows workloads of many thousands of tasks to be performed efficiently over many distributed resources and frees the user from the laborious process of managing task deployment, execution and result collection. However, in many cases the High Throughput Computing system is comprised from volunteer computational resources where tasks may be evicted by the owner of the resource. This has two main disadvantages. First, tasks may take longer to run as they may require multiple deployments before finally obtaining enough time on a resource to complete. Second, the wasted computation time will lead to wasted energy. We may be able to reduce the effect of the first disadvantage here by submitting multiple replicas of the task and take the results from the first one to complete. This, though, could lead to a significant increase in energy consumption. Thus we desire to only ever submit the minimum number of replicas required to run the task in the allocated time whilst simultaneously minimising energy. In this work we evaluate the use of fixed replica counts and Reinforcement Learning on the proportion of task which fail to finish in a given time-frame and the energy consumed by the system.},

abstract = {In light of the increased awareness of global energy consumption, questions are also being asked about the contribution of computing equipment. Though studies have documented the share of energy consumption due to these equipment over the years, these have rarely characterized the increasing share contributed by the rapidly growing portable computing segment. The portable computing device segment is widely predicted to be a dominant mode of computing and communication, and accounting for its energy consumption is necessary for energy-efficient computing in the future. This work takes a fresh and updated look at the energy consumption due to computing devices in perspective of global consumption, and pays special attention to the contribution of portable computing devices. We further quantify the impact of energy consumed by the computing sector on the environment, as well as on the electricity cost to an average residential consumer. Finally, based on the results of the study, recommendations targeted at the computer networking community are made.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency of servers has become a significant research topic over the last years, as server energy consumption varies depending on multiple factors, such as server utilization and workload type. Server energy analysis and estimation must take all relevant factors into account to ensure reliable estimates and conclusions. Thorough system analysis requires benchmarks capable of testing different system resources at different load levels using multiple workload types. Server energy estimation approaches, on the other hand, require knowledge about the interactions of these factors for the creation of accurate power models. Common approaches to energy-aware workload classification categorize workloads depending on the resource types used by the different workloads. However, they rarely take into account differences in workloads targeting the same resources. Industrial energy-efficiency benchmarks typically do not evaluate the system's energy consumption at different resource load levels, and they only provide data for system analysis at maximum system load.In this paper, we benchmark multiple server configurations using the CPU worklets included in SPEC's Server Efficiency Rating Tool (SERT). We evaluate the impact of load levels and different CPU workloads on power consumption and energy efficiency. We analyze how functions approximating the measured power consumption differ over multiple server configurations and architectures. We show that workloads targeting the same resource can differ significantly in their power draw and energy efficiency. The power consumption of a given workload type varies depending on utilization, hardware and software configuration. The power consumption of CPU-intensive workloads does not scale uniformly with increased load, nor do hardware or software configuration changes affect it in a uniform manner.},

abstract = {Energy consumption is a growing issue in data centers, impacting their economic viability and their public image. In this work we empirically characterize the power and energy consumed by different types of servers. In particular, in order to understand the behavior of their energy and power consumption, we perform measurements in different servers. In each of them, we exhaustively measure the power consumed by the CPU, the disk, and the network interface under different configurations, identifying the optimal operational levels. One interesting conclusion of our study is that the curve that defines the minimal CPU power as a function of the load is neither linear nor purely convex as has been previously assumed. Moreover, we find that the efficiency of the various server components can be maximized by tuning the CPU frequency and the number of active cores as a function of the system and network load, while the block size of I/O operations should be always maximized by applications. We also show how to estimate the energy consumed by an application as a function of some simple parameters, like the CPU load, and the disk and network activity. We validate the proposed approach by accurately estimating the energy of a map-reduce computation in a Hadoop platform.},

abstract = {Dynamic frequency and voltage scaling (DVFS) techniques have been widely used for meeting energy constraints. Single-chip many-core systems bring new challenges owing to the large number of operating points and the shift to message passing interface (MPI) from shared memory communication. DVFS, however, has been mostly studied on single-chip systems with one or few cores, without considering the impact of the communication among cores. This paper evaluates the impact of frequency scaling on the performance and power of many-core systems with MPI. We conduct experiments on the Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC), an experimental many-core processor developed by Intel. The paper first introduces the run-time monitoring infrastructure and the application suite we have designed for an in-depth evaluation of the SCC. We provide an extensive analysis quantifying the effects of frequency perturbations on performance and energy efficiency. Experimental results show that run-time communication patterns lead to significant differences in power/performance tradeoffs in many-core systems with MPI.},

abstract = {Recently, power has emerged as a critical factor in designing components of storage systems, especially for power-hungry data centers. While there is some research into power-aware storage stack components, there are no systematic studies evaluating each component's impact separately. This paper evaluates the file system's impact on energy consumption and performance. We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and file server. In case of a server node consisting of a single disk, CPU power generally exceeds disk-power consumption. However, file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power. We discovered that default file system options are often suboptimal, and even poor. We show that a carefulmatching of expectedworkloads to file system types and options can improve power-performance efficiency by a factor ranging from 1.05 to 9.4 times.},

Power consumption is a challenge facing the Cloud Providers to operate their Datacenters. One solution to overcome this is the Virtual Machine (VM) migration, which is a technique used to switch under-utilized hosts to sleep mode in order to save power, and to avoid over-utilized hosts from Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation. But still the problem is that the Cloud Service Provider apply a single policy on all nodes. Our proposed solution is an adaptive power panel where different policies can be applied based on both of the nature of the tasks running on hosts, and the Cloud Provider decision.},

In this paper, we propose a low-cost novel power monitoring approach that uses only one sensor to extract power consumption information of all servers. We utilize the conducted electromagnetic interference of server power supplies to measure its power consumption from non-intrusive single-point voltage measurement. Using a pair of commercial grade Dell PowerEdge servers, we demonstrate that our approach can estimate each server's power consumption with ~3% mean absolute percentage error.},

abstract = {The increased use of IT technologies and number of IT users have triggered cloud computing resource demand including the need for more data centers. Each data center consumes electricity for its un-interrupted operations and maintenance, therefore responsible for the emissions of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas causing climate change. Hence, there is a necessity to provide a solution through which energy consumption for cloud data centers can be reduced. As virtual machine located in data center are run under loaded to maintain higher performance but it causes wastage of resources and power. While, task overloading severally reduce the performance of data center. To address this issue, we propose CMBA (Cluster and Migration Based Approach) for cloud resource allocation that maps groups of tasks to customized virtual machine types based on processing, memory and network requirements. Proper placement of workload with specific VMs and dynamic migration concept reduce energy consumption for running physical machine and its respective host or data centers. Taking altogether, intelligent customization of virtual machines by adopting CMBA approach will maintain high efficiency of datacenters with reduced energy consumption.},

abstract = {Global warming, which is currently one of the greatest environmental challenges, is caused by carbon emissions. A report from the Energy Information Administration indicates that approximately 98% of CO2 emissions can be attributed to energy consumption. The trade-off between efficient and ecologically sound operation represents a major challenge faced by many organizations at present. In addition, numerous companies are currently compelled to pay a carbon tax for the resources they use and the environmental impact of their products and services. Therefore, an energy consumption system can generate actual financial payback. Green information technology involves various approaches, including power management, recycling, telecommunications, and virtualization. This paper focuses on comparing and evaluating techniques used for reducing energy consumption in virtualized environments. We first highlight the impact of virtualization techniques on minimizing energy consumption in cloud computing. Then we present an experimental comparative study between two common energy-efficient task scheduling algorithms in cloud computing (i.e., the green scheduler, the power saver scheduler). These algorithms are discussed briefly and analyzed. The three metrics used to evaluate the task scheduling algorithms are (1) total power consumption, (2) data center load, and (3) virtual machine load. This work aims to gauge and subsequently improve energy consumption efficiency in virtualized environments.},

The challenges are directly linked to the peak power consumption of servers.Our solution, Power Shifting, reduces the peak power consumption of servers minimizing the impact on performance. We reduce peak power consumption by using workload-guided dynamic allocation of power among components incorporating real-time performance feedback, activity-related power estimation techniques, and performance-sensitive activity-regulation mechanisms to enforce power budgets.We apply our techniques to a computer system with a single processor and memory. Power shifting adds a system power manager with a dynamic, global view of the system's power consumption to continuously re-budget the available power amongst the two components. Our contributions include:• Demonstration of the greater effectiveness of dynamic power allocation over static budgeting,• Evaluation of different power shifting policies,• Analysis of system and workload factors critical to successful power shifting, and• Proposal of performance-sensitive power budget enforcement mechanisms that ensure system reliability.},

abstract = {Transiently powered computers (TPCs) form the foundation of the battery-less Internet of Things, using energy harvesting and small capacitors to power their operation. This kind of power supply is characterized by extreme variations in supply voltage, as capacitors charge when harvesting energy and discharge when computing. We experimentally find that these variations cause marked fluctuations in clock speed and power consumption. Such a deceptively minor observation is overlooked in existing literature. Systems are thus designed and parameterized in overly conservative ways, missing on a number of optimizations.We rather demonstrate that it is possible to accurately model and concretely capitalize on these fluctuations. We derive an energy model as a function of supply voltage and prove its use in two settings. First, we develop EPIC, a compile-time energy analysis tool. We use it to substitute for the constant power assumption in existing analysis techniques, giving programmers accurate information on worst-case energy consumption of programs. When using EPIC with existing TPC system support, run-time energy efficiency drastically improves, eventually leading up to a 350% speedup in the time to complete a fixed workload. Further, when using EPIC with existing debugging tools, it avoids unnecessary program changes that hurt energy efficiency. Next, we extend the MSPsim emulator and explore its use in parameterizing a different TPC system support. The improvements in energy efficiency yield up to more than 1000% time speedup to complete a fixed workload.},

We present a new energy consumption model and associated analysis tool for Cloud computing environments. We measure energy consumption in Cloud environments based on different runtime tasks. Empirical analysis of the correlation of energy consumption and Cloud data and computational tasks, as well as system performance, will be investigated based on our energy consumption model and analysis tool. Our research results can be integrated into Cloud systems to monitor energy consumption and support static or dynamic system-level optimisation.},

However, until recently little evaluation has been performed on the energy impact of HTC. Many organisations now seek to minimise energy consumption across their IT infrastructure though it is unclear how this will affect the usability of HTC systems. We present here HTC-Sim, a simulation system which allows the evaluation of different energy reduction policies across an HTC system comprising a collection of computational resources dedicated to HTC work and resources provided through cycle scavenging--a Desktop Grid. We demonstrate that our simulation software scales linearly with increasing HTC workload.},

abstract = {Cloud computing delivers IT solutions as a utility to users. One consequence of this model is that large cloud data centres consume large amounts of energy and produce significant carbon footprints. A common objective of cloud providers is to develop resource provisioning and management solutions that minimise energy consumption while guaranteeing Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In order to achieve this objective, a thorough understanding of energy consumption patterns in complex cloud systems is imperative. We have developed an energy consumption model for cloud computing systems. To operationalise this model, we have conducted extensive experiments to profile the energy consumption in cloud computing systems based on three types of tasks: computation-intensive, data-intensive and communication-intensive tasks. We collected fine-grained energy consumption and performance data with varying system configurations and workloads. Our experimental results show the correlation coefficients of energy consumption, system configuration and workload, as well as system performance in cloud systems. These results can be used for designing energy consumption monitors, and static or dynamic system-level energy consumption optimisation strategies for green cloud computing systems.},

abstract = {As a global digitization advancement, there is a massive need of cloud-based solutions and data centers. Another reason behind excessive need of data centers is because of increasing number of internet users. Increasing demand of data centers simultaneously need huge amount of energy for data center operation and on other end emit enormous amount of CO2. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce energy consumption, but major concern is by looking at one parameter or criteria they must compromise on other. Our proposed approach MIPS-Aware VM Placement in combination with searching of best capable host helps to reduce VM migration and increase mean time for better performance and save energy. Proposed approach identifies overloaded and underloaded hosts and to improve system performance algorithm does not allow to allocate additional workload, which will also help to reduce energy and get better QoS. Proposed approach significantly decreases VM migration and increase mean time before VM migration which in turns helps to reduce energy and associated cost. By using proposed MIPS-Aware VM Placement approach, we can reduce upto 25% more energy consumption compared to traditional approaches.},

isbn = {9780769556970},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {As of 2010 data centers use 1.5% of global electricity production and this is expected to keep growing [1]. There is a need for a near real-time power consumption modeling/monitoring system that could be used at scale within a Software Defined Data Center (SDDC). The power consumption models and information they provide can then be used to make better decisions for data center orchestration, e.g., whether to migrate virtual machines to reduce power consumption. We propose a scalable system that would 1) create initial power consumption models, as needed, for data center components, and 2) could be continually refined while the components are in use. The models will be used for the near real-time monitoring of power consumption, as well as predicting power consumption before and after potential orchestration decisions. The first step towards this goal of whole data center power modeling and prediction is to be able to predict the power consumption of one server effectively, based on high level utilization statistics from that server. In this paper we present a novel method for modeling whole system power consumption for a server, under varying random levels of CPU utilization, with a scalable random forest based model, that utilizes statistics available at the data center management level.},

abstract = {There is growing interest to replace traditional servers with low-power multicore systems such as ARM Cortex-A9. However, such systems are typically provisioned for mobile applications that have lower memory and I/O requirements than server application. Thus, the impact and extent of the imbalance between application and system resources in exploiting energy efficient execution of server workloads is unclear. This paper proposes a trace-driven analytical model for understanding the energy performance of server workloads on ARM Cortex-A9 multicore systems. Key to our approach is the modeling of the degrees of CPU core, memory and I/O resource overlap, and in estimating the number of cores and clock frequency that optimizes energy performance without compromising execution time. Since energy usage is the product of utilized power and execution time, the model first estimates the execution time of a program. CPU time, which accounts for both cores and memory response time, is modeled as an M/G/1 queuing system. Workload characterization of high performance computing, web hosting and financial computing applications shows that bursty memory traffic fits a Pareto distribution, and non-bursty memory traffic is exponentially distributed. Our analysis using these server workloads reveals that not all server workloads might benefit from higher number of cores or clock frequencies. Applying our model, we predict the configurations that increase energy efficiency by 10% without turning off cores, and up to one third with shutting down unutilized cores. For memory-bounded programs, we show that the limited memory bandwidth might increase both execution time and energy usage, to the point where energy cost might be higher than on a typical x64 multicore system. Lastly, we show that increasing memory and I/O bandwidth can improve both the execution time and the energy usage of server workloads on ARM Cortex-A9 systems.},

During training, GRANNITE learns how to propagate average toggle rates through combinational logic: a netlist is represented as a graph, register states and unit inputs from RTL simulation are used as features, and combinational gate toggle rates are used as labels. A trained GNN model can then infer average toggle rates on a new workload of interest or new netlists from RTL simulation results in a few seconds. Compared to traditional power analysis using gate-level simulations, GRANNITE achieves &gt;18.7X speedup with an error of only &lt;5.5% across a diverse set of benchmark circuits. Compared to a GPU-accelerated conventional probabilistic switching activity estimation approach, GRANNITE achieves much better accuracy (on average 25.9% lower error) at similar runtimes.},

Edge inference, in which inference is performed locally in embedded systems with limited power resources, is researched for its energy efficiency. An approximate encoder is proposed in this study for decreasing switching activity, which minimizes power consumption in CNN accelerators at the edge. The proposed encoder performs approximate encoding based on a pattern matching of a comparison pattern and current data. Software determines the value of the comparison pattern and the availability of the recommended encoder. Experiments with a CIFAR-10 dataset utilizing LeNet5 show that using the suggested encoder, depending upon the comparison pattern, power consumption of a CNN accelerator can be reduced by 21.5% with 1.59% degradation on inference quality.},

These experimental data are provided by time-consuming and cost-intensive experiments. In contrast, various modified nucleotides in RNAs, which would affect not only their structures but also functions, have been found, and rapid determination of energy parameters for a such modified nucleotides is needed. To reduce the high cost of determining energy parameters, we propose a novel method to estimate energy parameters from both experimental and computational data, where the computational data are provided by a recently developed molecular dynamics simulation protocol. We evaluate our method for Watson-Crick stacked base pairs, and show that parameters estimated from 10 experimental data items and 10 computational data items can predict RNA secondary structures with accuracy comparable to that using conventional parameters. The results indicate that the combination of experimental free-energy measurements and molecular dynamics simulations is capable of estimating the thermodynamic properties of RNA secondary structures at lower cost.},

abstract = {Improving the energy efficiency of smartphones is critical for increasing the utility that they provide to the users. With most mobile operating systems, users are responsible for managing their phone's battery efficiency by utilizing the various settings provided by the operating system, as well as selecting energy-efficient apps. However, current app marketplaces do not provide users with information about app energy efficiency, which makes it challenging for the user to make informed decision when selecting an app. This paper presents a novel machine learning approach to estimate app energy efficiency by utilizing textual information available in the Google Play store such as an app's description, user reviews, as well as system permissions. Our detailed analysis of the resulting system shows that hardware permissions, app description, and user reviews correlate well with energy efficiency ratings. We evaluate five models that represent popular classes of machine learning algorithms in their ability to predict energy efficiency ratings. Finally, we compare our approach to gold truth ratings obtained by the actual energy profiling of the app, demonstrating that the proposed system is able to estimate an app's energy efficiency within less than 1 point on the 1-5 scale provided by the profiler, without requiring any kind of profiling.},

The emergence of advanced technologies such as cloud-based services, internet of things (IoT), and big data analytics has augmented the growth of global data centers, leading to high energy consumption. This upsurge in energy consumption of the data centers not only incurs the issue of surging high cost (operational and maintenance) but also has an adverse effect on the environment. Dynamic power management in a data center environment requires the cognizance of the correlation between the system and hardware-level performance counters and the power consumption. Power consumption modeling exhibits this correlation and is crucial in designing energy-efficient optimization strategies based on resource utilization. Several works in power modeling are proposed and used in the literature. However, these power models have been evaluated using different benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error-calculation formulas on different machines. In this work, we present a taxonomy and evaluation of 24 software-based power models using a unified environment, benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error formulas, with the aim of achieving an objective comparison. We use different server architectures to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the models’ comparison. The performance analysis of these models is elaborated in the article.},

They are the most effective and achievable communication and computation devices that necessitate no exact time or location. Fast development of movable calculation created an energetic power to develop a synchronous technology in the markets. Anyhow movable devices are encountering with various challenges concerning available resources such as: battery, storage, bandwidth, security, and mobility. On the other side, limitation of resources in these phones has a great effect on the quality of the services. The most important limitation is the energy consuming that leads us to use the device for calculation, in spite of the accessibility of other sources. The best suggested solutions are getting rid of computation on the cloud and use of portable cloud for computation. But If there was no accessible cloud or an accurace of disconnection with the cloud, cell phones are the best to use. According to a mathematical algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization and regarding the requirement time for suitable program, we will try to introduce a dynamic way which its limitation analysis reveals that offlooding the computation considering the limitation of time leads to a less spending of power and energy resembled the current algorithm.},

The rise of use cases of AI catered towards the Edge, where devices have limited computation power and storage capabilities, motivates the need for better understating of how AI performs and consumes energy. Goal. The aim of this paper is to empirically assess the impact of three different AI containerization strategies on the energy consumption, execution time, CPU, and memory usage for computer-vision tasks on the Edge. Method. In this paper we conduct an experiment with the used containerization strategy as main factor, with three treatments: ONNX Runtime, WebAssembly, and Docker. The subjects of the experiment are four widely-used computer-vision algorithms. We then orchestrate a series of runs where we deploy the four subjects on different generations of Raspberry Pi devices, with different hardware capabilities. A total of 120 runs (per device) are recorded to gather data on energy, execution time, CPU, and memory. Results. We found a statistically significant difference between the three containerization strategies on all dependent variables. Specifically, WebAssembly proves to be a valuable alternative for devices with reduced disk space and computation power. Conclusions. For computer-vision tasks with limited disk space and RAM memory requirements, developers should prefer WebAssembly for deployment. The (non-dockerized) ONNX Runtime resulted to be the best choice in terms of energy consumption and execution time.},

Every point on the resulting curve is the global optimum of the corresponding gate sizing problem. The problem is solved by mapping it onto piecewise linear models in such a way, that a piecewise linear (circuit) simulator can do the job.

The proposed framework utilizes convolution layers to extract features from the input data space without changing spatial relations between variables. These features are memorized by tensor train based gated recurrent units for an accurate long-term prediction. We observe that this sequential framework helps to improve long term prediction accuracy, thereby mitigating prediction error accumulation over time. Although architectures comprising the amalgamation of convolution layers and memory cell have shown promising results in domains such as social media analysis, language modeling, video frame prediction, and image recognition, this paper extends its scope to the context of energy applications. Furthermore, the addition of tensor train based gated recurrent units is motivated by the necessity of computational time reduction during the training process, thereby making this framework suitable for field deployment. Results on a commercial building dataset show that the current framework outperforms other existing machine learning based methods, in both short-term and long-term prediction categories.},

abstract = {Recently, researchers were focusing on integrating renewable energy (RE) within urban environment instead of integrating renewables with buildings due to the large occupies of urban areas. Urban areas have a great potential in generating sufficient amount of energy that could satisfy the needs of urban neighborhoods. Energy-scape elements are sustainable elements that integrates RE devices with landscape elements. This research focuses on analyzing the importance and efficiency of Energy-scape software through a qualitative method. The efficiency of Energy-scape web-based application will be tested using qualitative method and a site survey. The research concludes that Energy-scape software application is an effective tool for landscape designers in using Energy-scape elements, it identifies the optimum type and location of Energy-scape elements within their projects, and it calculates the impact of using Energy-scape elements in term of energy-savings and carbon emission (CO2) reduction.},

abstract = {Energy consumption analysis of IT-controlled systems can play a major role in minimising the overall energy consumption of such IT systems, during the development phase, or for optimisation in the field. As software is increasingly embedded in our daily life, with IT using more and more energy, the software industry should become aware of their energy footprint, and methods must be developed to assist in reducing this footprint.Recently, we developed a precise energy analysis, to analyse software in conjunction with hardware. It has the property of being parametric with regard to the hardware. In principle, this creates the opportunity to investigate which is the best software implementation for given hardware, or the other way around: choose the best hardware for a given algorithm.},

Therefore, we have surveyed the available research on assessing the energy consumption of software systems, which showed a lack of development tools, but several approaches exist for measuring the energy consumption. We group these approaches according to how measurement data is made available and compare several characteristics of the collected data. The survey shows that not only development tools for software energy optimization are still missing, but there is also a lack of fine-grained measurement approaches as well as approaches for general-purpose platforms.},

However, measuring accurately this consumption is a major challenge that state-of-the-art approaches have tried to tackle with a limited success. While monitoring applications' consumption offers a clear insight on where the energy is being spent, it does not help in understanding how the energy is consumed. In this paper, we therefore introduce JalenUnit, a software framework that infers the energy consumption model of software libraries from execution traces. This model can then be used to diagnose application code for detecting energy bugs, understanding energy distribution, establishing energy profiles and classifications, and comparing software libraries against their energy consumption.},

abstract = {Software producing organizations have the ability to address the energy impact of their ICT solutions during the development process. However, while industry is convinced of the energy impact of hardware, the role of software has mostly been acknowledged by researchers in software engineering. Strengthened by the limited practical knowledge to reduce the energy consumption, organizations have less control over the energy impact of their products and lose the contribution of software towards energy related strategies. Consequently, industry risks not being able to meet customer requirements or even fulfill corporate sustainability goals.In this paper we perform an exploratory case study on how to create and maintain awareness on an energy consumption perspective for software among stakeholders involved with the development of software products. During the study, we followed the development process of two commercial software products and provided direct feedback to the stakeholders on the effects of their development efforts, specifically concerning energy consumption and performance, using an energy dashboard. Multiple awareness measurements allowed us to keep track of changes over time on specific aspects affecting software development. Our results show that, despite a mixed sentiment towards the dashboard, changed awareness has triggered discussion on the energy consumption of software.},

As software took control over hardware in many domains, the question of the energy footprint induced by the software is becoming critical for our society, as the resources powering the underlying infrastructure are finite.

The purpose of this study is to better understand the root causes that prevent the issue of software energy consumption to be more widely considered by developers and companies.Method.

This paper covers an industrial case study of developers' awareness of green software design and how to promote it within the company. While it might not be generalizable for any company, we believe our results deliver a common body of knowledge with implications to be considered for similar cases and further researches.},

This paper considers the energy consumption and performance of servers running a relatively simple file-compression workload. We found that standard techniques for system identification do not produce acceptable models of energy consumption and performance, due to the intricate interplay between the discrete nature of software and the continuous nature of energy and performance. This motivated us to perform a detailed empirical study of the energy consumption and performance of this system with varying compression algorithms and compression levels, file types, persistent storage media, CPU DVFS levels, and disk I/O schedulers. Our results identify and illustrate factors that complicate the system's energy consumption and performance, including nonlinearity, instability, and multi-dimensionality. Our results provide a basis for future work on modeling energy consumption and performance to support principled design of controllable energy-aware systems.},

Yet, few techniques address this concern for Software Product Lines (SPL). In this paper, we therefore introduce two approaches to measure and reduce the energy consumption of a SPL by analyzing a limited set of products sampled from this SPL. While the first approach relies on the analysis of individual feature consumptions, the second one takes feature interactions into account to better mitigate energy consumption of resulting products.Our experimental results on a real-world SPL indicate that both approaches succeed to produce significant energy improvements on a large number of products, while consumption data was modeled from a small set of sampled products. Furthermore, we show that taking feature interactions into account leads to more products improved with higher energy savings per product.},

abstract = {Discrete manufacturing is known to be a high consumer of energy and much work has been done in continuous improvement and energy saving methods addressing this issue. Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, commonly used in the manufacturing of metal parts, are highly energy-demanding because of many required sub-systems, such as cooling, lubrication, logical interfaces and electric motors. For this reason, there is a large body of work focusing on modelling the energy needs of this class of machine.This paper applies Grammatical Evolution (GE) for developing auto-regressive models for the energy consumption of a CNC machine. Empirical data from three 24-hour work shifts comprising three different types of products are used as inputs. We also introduce an autocorrelation-informed approach for the grammar, which benefits from a prior analysis of the training data for better capturing periodic or close to periodic behaviour. Finally, we compare the outcomes from real and predicted energy profiles through the use of an existing analysis tool, which is capable of extracting production-related information such as total and average KW consumption, number of parts produced and breakdown of production and idle hours. Results show that GE yields accurate and explainable models for the analysed scenario.},

abstract = {While a significant body of work in compilers has been devoted to reducing energy consumption in embedded systems, the role of a compiler in harnessing the power variation has not been widely explored. Since sharp power variations across time steps cause power supply noises and degrade reliability of functional blocks, power variation is a design constraint in embedded systems. With the advent of high performance embedded systems and extensive deployment of fine grain clock-gating, reducing variations in power is becoming increasingly important.This paper studies how compilation techniques, more specifically instruction scheduling, can ameliorate variations in power due to functional units during program execution. By extending our previous work on rate-optimal software pipelining, this paper formulates the problem of constructing a performance-optimal schedule that minimizes power variations as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The formulation can be solved using an ILP solver. We applied our approach on <tt>SPEC NAS</tt> benchmarks to construct software pipelined schedules that have minimum power variations. The benchmarks are executed on the Wattch power simulator. In comparison to the original (power-unaware) scheduler implemented in the MIPSpro compiler, our power-aware approach generates schedules which have significantly lower power variations while maintaining the same performance. Such schedules have the potential to reduce hardware cost on power delivery in designing embedded systems.},

abstract = {Software is present in all types of devices, some of them with restrictions as to the amount of energy they can spend to execute software applications. For this reason, energy costs are becoming an important factor during software development and evolution. However, there is still little support for creating energy-efficient software. In this work, we introduce a possible framework for software energy costs evaluation based on model analysis. We model software as Labelled Transitions Systems (LTS) and annotate these models with energy costs, which can be obtained using existing tools. We can then apply graph-based algorithms to traverse the models to obtain information about energy consumption related to software behaviour, such as its most/least costly execution, the cost of a specific execution, and the average cost of executing the software. No existing tool currently provides all the necessary analyses, even though they are essential for energy-consumption evaluation. We have conducted a small experiment with our framework where we employed jRAPL to measure energy costs. We annotated the models with the collected energy costs using an extended version of the LoTuS tool, where we have also implemented some of the desired analyses. Based on this support and on our initial results, we believe developers could create software more energy-efficient and consider possible trade-offs related to time, space, and energy costs when producing new versions of their systems.},

year = {2017},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The emergence of Internet of Things increases the complexity and the heterogeneity of computing platforms. Migrating workload between various platforms is one way to improve both energy efficiency and performance. Effective migration decisions require accurate estimates of its costs and benefits. To date, these estimates were done by either instrumenting the source code/binaries, thus causing high overhead, or by using power estimates from hardware performance counters, which work well for individual machines, but until now have not been accurate for predicting across different architectures. In this paper, we propose P4, a new Phase-based Power and Performance Prediction framework which identifies cross-platform application power and performance at runtime for heterogeneous computing systems. P4 analyzes and detects machine-independent application phases by characterizing computing platforms offline with a set of benchmarks, and then builds neural network-based models to automatically identify and generalize the complex cross-platform relationships for each benchmark phase. It then leverages these models along with performance counter measurements collected at runtime to estimate performance and power consumption if it were running on a completely different computing platform, including a different CPU architecture, without ever having to run it on there. We evaluate the proposed framework on four commercial heterogeneous platforms, ranging from X86 servers to mobile ARM-based architecture, with 129 industry-standard benchmarks. Our experimental results show that P4 can predict the power and performance changes with only 6.8% and 5.6% error, respectively, even for completely different architectures from the ones applications ran on.},

This paper makes the following three contributions: First, the model is one of the first realistic models which consider ICN packet forwarding and packet-level caching.

Many approaches tackle this problem from the point of view of different hardware components, such as CPUs, storage and network interface cards (NIC). To this date, few works focused on the energy consumption of network transfers at the software level comprising their complete stacks with different energy characteristics, and the way the NIC selection impacts the energy consumption of applications. Since data centres often install multiple NICs on each node, investigating and comparing them at the software level has high potential to enhance the energy efficiency of applications on Cloud infrastructures. We present a comparative analysis of the energy consumption of the software stack of two of today's most used NICs in data centres, Ethernet and Infiniband. We carefully design for this purpose a set of benchmark experiments to assess the impact of different traffic patterns and interface settings on energy consumption. Using our benchmark results, we derive an energy consumption model for network transfers and evaluate its accuracy for a virtual machine migration scenario. Finally, we propose guidelines for NIC selection from an energy efficiency perspective for different application classes.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity laboratory infrastructure has direct impact on the quality of student learning experiences. Because of this, the computing education field has developed a variety of approaches to designing and implementing these learning facilities. Yet, little work has gone into how to properly size cybersecurity laboratory infrastructure relative to student population and curricular compute power demands. The result has been laboratory infrastructures that do not scale with degree programs. Consequently, laboratories are either underpowered, thus limiting learning experiences, or overpowered which wastes financial resources. Accordingly, this work presents DRAT, an open-source software tool, for estimating necessary compute power in a cybersecurity engineering learning facility. More specifically, DRAT is designed to estimate the required discrete compute power on a per exercise basis in a cybersecurity engineering learning facility operating in a private cloud model. Such discrete estimations are intended to communicate physical host hardware requirements such as physical CPU core count, virtual RAM, and total Hard Disk space. The first step in designing DRAT was to forge a model estimator function. Then, we identified a series of scalar abstractions representing learning facility hardware infrastructure and behaving as conversion factors between the model function and output. Because the goal of this work was to provide estimates for cloud compute power requirements, DRAT outputs the number of physical cores, total RAM, total Disk, and total (virtual or physical) Network interfaces required to run the indicated scenario. The implication is that such estimates can inform purchasing and configuration decisions which directly impact student learning outcomes.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a new, simple, accurate, and fast power estimation technique that can be used to explore the power consumption of digital system designs at an early design stage. We exploit the machine learning techniques to aid the designers in exploring the design space of possible architectural solutions, and more specifically, their dynamic power consumption, which is application-, technology-, frequency-, and data-stimuli dependent. To model the power and the behavior of digital components, we adopt the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while the final target technology is Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The main characteristic of the proposed method, called NeuPow, is that it relies on propagating the signals throughout connected ANN models to predict the power consumption of a composite system. Besides a baseline version of the NeuPow methodology that works for a given predefined operating frequency, we also derive an upgraded version that is frequency-aware, where the same operating frequency is taken as additional input by the ANN models. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we perform different assessments at different levels. Moreover, technology and scalability studies have been conducted, proving the NeuPow robustness in terms of these design parameters. Results show a very good estimation accuracy with less than 9% of relative error independently from the technology and the size/layers of the design. NeuPow is also delivering a speed-up factor of about 84\texttimes{} with respect to the classical power estimation flow.},

abstract = {As high-performance computing (HPC) resources continue to grow in size and complexity, so too does the volume and velocity of the operational data that is associated with them. At such scales, new mechanisms and technologies are required to continuously gather, store, and analyze this data in near-real time from heterogeneous and distributed sources without impacting the underlying data center operations or HPC resource utilization. In this paper, we describe our experiences in designing and implementing an infrastructure for extreme-scale operational data collection, known as the Operations Monitoring and Notification Infrastructure (OMNI) at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. OMNI currently holds over 522 billion records of online operational data (totaling over 125TB) and can ingest new data points at an average rate of 25,000 data points per second. Using OMNI as a central repository, facilities and environmental data can be seamlessly integrated and correlated with machine metrics, job scheduler information, network errors, and more, providing a holistic view of data center operations. To demonstrate the value of real-time operational data collection, we present a number of real-world case studies for which having OMNI data readily available led to key operational insights at NERSC. The case results include a reduction in the downtime of an HPC system during a facility transition, as well as a $2.5 million electrical substation savings for the next-generation Perlmutter HPC system.},

abstract = {GreenIT has emerged as a discipline concerned with the optimization of software solutions with regards to their energy consumption. In this domain, most of the state-of-the-art solutions concentrate on coarse-grained approaches to monitor the energy consumption of a device or a process. However, none of the existing solutions addresses in-process energy monitoring to provide in-depth analysis of a process energy consumption. In this paper, we therefore report on a fine-grained runtime energy monitoring framework we developed to help developers to diagnose energy hotspots with a better accuracy than the state-of-the-art. Concretely, our approach adopts a 2-layer architecture including OS-level and process-level energy monitoring. OS-level energy monitoring estimates the energy consumption of processes according to different hardware devices (CPU, network card). Process-level energy monitoring focuses on Java-based applications and builds on OS-level energy monitoring to provide an estimation of energy consumption at the granularity of classes and methods. We argue that this per-method analysis of energy consumption provides better insights to the application in order to identify potential energy hotspots. In particular, our preliminary validation demonstrates that we can monitor energy hotspots of Jetty web servers and monitor their variations under stress scenarios.},

abstract = {Software energy estimation is a critical step in the design of energy-efficient embedded systems. Instruction-level simulation techniques, despite several advances, remain too slow for iterative use in system-level exploration. In this paper, we propose a methodology called hybrid simulation, which combines instruction set simulation with selective native execution (execution of some parts of the program directly on the simulation host computer), thereby overcoming the disadvantages of instruction-level simulation (low speed) and pure native execution (estimation accuracy, inapplicability to target-dependent code), while exploiting their advantages. Previously developed techniques for software energy macromodeling are utilized to estimate energy consumption for natively executed sub-programs. We identify and address the main challenges involved in hybrid simulation, and present an automatic tool flow for it, which analyzes a given program and selects functions for native execution in order to achieve maximum estimation efficiency while limiting estimation error. We have applied the proposed hybrid simulation methodology to a variety of embedded software programs, resulting in an average speed-up of 70% and estimation error of at most 6%, compared to one of the fastest publicly-available instruction set simulators.},

However, most of the existing DNNs models for NILM use a single-task learning approach in which a neural network is trained exclusively for each appliance. This strategy is computationally expensive and ignores the fact that multiple appliances can be active simultaneously and dependencies between them. In this work, we propose UNet-NILM for multi-task appliances' state detection and power estimation, applying a multi-label learning strategy and multi-target quantile regression. The UNet-NILM is a one-dimensional CNN based on the U-Net architecture initially proposed for image segmentation. Empirical evaluation on the UK-DALE dataset suggests promising performance against traditional single-task learning.},

We compare their energy and performance results against raw reads and writes. Our results reveal that software based data compression cannot be considered as a universal solution to reduce energy consumption. Various factors like the type of the data file, the compression tool being used, the read-to-write ratio of the workload, and the hardware configuration of the system impact the efficacy of this technique. In some cases, however, we found compression to save substantial energy and improve performance.},

abstract = {Improvement in the energy efficiency of supercomputers can be accelerated by improving the quality and comparability of efficiency measurements. The ability to generate accurate measurements at extreme scale are just now emerging. The realization of system-level measurement capabilities can be accelerated with a commonly adopted and high quality measurement methodology for use while running a workload, typically a benchmark. This paper describes a methodology that has been developed collaboratively through the Energy Efficient HPC Working Group to support architectural analysis and comparative measurements for rankings, such as the Top500 and Green500. To support measurements with varying amounts of effort and equipment required we present three distinct levels of measurement, which provide increasing levels of accuracy. Level 1 is similar to the Green500 run rules today, a single average power measurement extrapolated from a subset of a machine. Level 2 is more comprehensive, but still widely achievable. Level 3 is the most rigorous of the three methodologies but is only possible at a few sites. However, the Level 3 methodology generates a high quality result that exposes details that the other methodologies may miss. In addition, we present case studies from the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Calcul Qu\'{e}bec Universit\'{e} Laval that explore the benefits and difficulties of gathering high quality, system-level measurements on large-scale machines.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a problem of modeling the power consumption of advanced off-the-shelf processors. Unlike existing methods for processor power estimation, where the internal information of processor architecture such as activation of specfic modules such as pipeline stages, etc.) is available via simulation or runtime counters, power modeling method presented in this paper is to estimate the power consumption of complex off-the-shelf RISC processor without such a detailed information, only based on the information of the processor I/O signals (i.e memory access). To tackle this problem, we propose a new power model, called IPI(Instruction-Prefetch Interval) power model. The IPI represents the time interval between two consecutive instruction prefetchs. Our model has two major advantages. First, this model can consider prefetch mechanism. Most of advanced RISC processors have prefetch mechanism which makes processor power estimation difficult. IPI model is the first approach to model prefetch mechanism in processor power estimation. Second, this model can provide power variation in time and therefore it overcomes the limitation of previous work, such as instruction-level energy model. Experiments show that the proposed model yields 96% accuracy on theaverage in case of ARM1136JF-S test chip.},

Unfortunately such predictors are extremely energy consuming and in some cases not practical as they come with excessive prediction latency. One example of such predictors is the O-GEHL predictor. To achieve high accuracy, O-GEHL relies on large tables and extensive computations and requires high energy and long prediction delay.In this work we propose power optimization techniques that aim at reducing both computational complexity and storage size for the O-GEHL predictor. We show that by eliminating unnecessary data from computations, we can reduce both predictor's energy consumption and delay. Moreover, we apply information theory findings to remove redundant storage, without any significant accuracy penalty. We reduce the dynamic and static power dissipated in the computational parts of the predictor by up to 74% and 65% respectively. Meantime we improve performance by up to 12% as we make faster prediction possible.},

However, choosing the most appropriate accelerator for such IoT devices is very challenging as they commonly should adhere to tight constraints e.g., low power consumption, long battery lifetime, and low cost of the final products. As a consequence, designing such application-specific IoT devices becomes a non-trivial and difficult task. In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimate power consumption of CUDA-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on GPGPUs in the design phase.

abstract = {Battery is a critical resource for smartphones. Software developers as the builders and maintainers of applications, are responsible for updating and deploying energy efficient applications to end users. Unfortunately, the impact of software change on energy consumption is still unclear. Estimation based on software metrics has proved difficult. As energy consumption profiling requires special infrastructure, developers have difficulty assessing the impact of their actions on energy consumption. System calls are the interface between applications and the OS kernel and provide insight into how software utilizes hardware and software resources. As profiling system calls requires no specialized infrastructure, unlike energy consumption, it is much easier for the developers to track changes to system calls. Thus we relate software change to energy consumption by tracing the changes in an application's pattern of system call invocations. We find that significant changes to system call profiles often induce significant changes in energy consumption.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are essential for emerging technologies such as autonomous driving and application-specific Internet of Things(IoT) devices. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is one of the major techniques used in such systems. This leads to leveraging ML accelerators like GPGPUs to meet the design constraints. However, GPGPUs have high power consumption, and selecting the most appropriate accelerator requires Design Space Exploration(DSE), which is usually time-consuming and needs high manual effort. Neural Hardware Search(NHS) is an upcoming approach to automate the DSE for Neural Networks. Therefore, automatic approaches for power, performance, and memory estimations are needed.In this paper, we present a novel approach, enabling designers to fast and accurately estimate the power consumption of CNNs inferencing on GPGPUs with Dynamic Frequency Scaling(DFS) in the early stages of the design process. The proposed approach uses static analysis for feature extraction and Random Forest Tree regression analysis for predictive model generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can predict the CNNs power consumption with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of 5.03% compared to the actual hardware.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of an ultra-low power cluster, built upon the Intel Edison based micro servers. The improved performance and high energy efficiency of micro servers have driven both academia and industry to explore the possibility of replacing conventional brawny servers with a larger swarm of embedded micro servers. Existing attempts mostly focus on mobile-class micro servers, whose capacities are similar to mobile phones. We, on the other hand, target on sensor-class micro servers, which are originally intended for uses in wearable technologies, sensor networks, and Internet-of-Things. Although sensor-class micro servers have much less capacity, they are touted for minimal power consumption (&lt; 1 Watt), which opens new possibilities of achieving higher energy efficiency in datacenter workloads. Our systematic evaluation of the Edison cluster and comparisons to conventional brawny clusters involve careful workload choosing and laborious parameter tuning, which ensures maximum server utilization and thus fair comparisons. Results show that the Edison cluster achieves up to 3.5x improvement on work-done-per-joule for web service applications and data-intensive MapReduce jobs. In terms of scalability, the Edison cluster scales linearly on the throughput of web service workloads, and also shows satisfactory scalability for MapReduce workloads despite coordination overhead.},

abstract = {Background. Often motivated by optimization objectives, software products are characterized by different subsequent releases and deployed through different strategies. The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products.Aims. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure.Method. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption.Results. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency.Conclusions. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered. The number of machines involved in a software deployment strategy does not simply constitute an additive effect of the energy consumption of the underlying hardware infrastructure.},

publisher = {EDA Consortium},
address = {San Jose, CA, USA},
abstract = {Software implementations of modern block ciphers often require large lookup tables along with code size increasing optimizations like loop unrolling to reach peak performance on general-purpose processors. Therefore, block ciphers are difficult to implement efficiently on embedded devices like cell phones or sensor nodes where run-time memory and program ROM are scarce resources. In this paper we analyze and compare the performance, energy consumption, run-time memory requirements, and code size of the five block ciphers RC6, Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish, and XTEA on the StrongARM SA-1100 processor. Most previous evaluations of block ciphers considered performance as the sole metric of interest and did not care about memory requirements or code size. In contrast to previous work, our study of the performance and energy characteristics of block ciphers has been conducted with "lightweight" implementations which restrict the size of lookup tables to 1 kB and also impose constraints on the code size. We found that Rijndael and RC6 can be well optimized for high performance and energy efficiency, while at the same time meeting the demand for low memory (RAM and ROM) footprint. In addition, we discuss the impact of key expansion and modes of operation on the overall performance and energy consumption of each block cipher. Our simulation results show that RC6 is the most energy-efficient block cipher under memory constraints and thus the best choice for resource-restricted devices.},

abstract = {Measuring software execution is important for many software engineering tasks. In this paper, Densification Power Law (DPL) of software execution is measured and studied as a feature of growing software complexity. Densification means that during a networked system's evolution, it usually becomes denser and the number of edges and nodes grows with a consistent super linear relation. This feature was discovered and reported in 2005. In this paper, based on a measurement of 15 open-source Java programs, we show that when software systems are modeled as a series of dynamic Call Graphs during their executions, they always obey DPL with very close correlation. Then a comparison between static Call Graph and DPL is presented, showing that DPL's properties cannot be derived statically. An explanation for DPL of software execution is given and verified. We believe the universality of DPL makes it an appropriate metric for software execution process.},

A flawed implementation is considered to contain code smells, known to have a negative influence on the energy consumption.Similar to technical debt, if energy debt is not properly addressed, it can accumulate an energy "interest". This interest will keep increasing as new versions of the software are released, and eventually reach a point where the interest will be higher than the initial energy debt. Addressing the issues/smells at such a point can remove energy debt, at the cost of having already consumed a significant amount of energy which can translate into high costs. We present all underlying concepts of energy debt, bridging the connection with the existing concept of technical debt and show how to compute the energy debt through a motivational example.},

abstract = {Software energy consumption is a relatively new concern for mobile application developers. Poor energy performance can harm adoption and sales of applications. Unfortunately for the developers, the measurement of software energy consumption is expensive in terms of hardware and difficult in terms of expertise. Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software running within emulators or virtual machines. Some prior models require actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application.In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications. This model leverages a big-data approach whereby a collection of prior applications' energy measurements allows us to train, transmit, and apply the model to estimate any foreign application's energy consumption for a test run. Our model is based on the dynamic traces of system calls and CPU utilization.},

abstract = {Many system-level management and optimization techniques need accurate estimates of power consumption and performance. Earlier research has proposed many high-level/source-level estimation modeling works, particularly for basic blocks. However, most of them still need to execute the target software at least once on a fine-grained simulator or real hardware to extract required features. This paper proposes a performance/power prediction framework, called Deep Power Meter (DeepPM), which estimates them accurately only using the compiled binary. Inspired by the deep learning techniques in natural language processing, we convert the program instructions in the form of vectors and predict the average power and performance of basic blocks based on a transformer model. In addition, unlike existing works based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model structure, which only works for basic blocks with a small number of instructions, DeepPM provides highly accurate results for long basic blocks, which takes the majority of the execution time for actual application runs. In our evaluation conducted with SPEC2006 benchmark suite, we show that DeepPM can provide accurate prediction for performance and power consumption with 10.2% and 12.3% error, respectively. DeepPM also outperforms the LSTM-based model by up to 67.2% and 34.9% error for performance and power, respectively.},

In this paper, we focus on the server infrastructure and observe that workload consolidation techniques, which maximize power efficiency of server systems, do not automatically optimize the overall system power efficiency especially when compute engines and the corresponding on-board cooling systems are considered holistically. We design SpinSmart, a framework that explores optimal server fan speeds to minimize the overall system energy consumption. We explore core capping strategies that estimate the desired number of CPU cores to be used at any given time to minimize combined CPU+fan power. Our experimental results show that we are able to achieve 1) energy savings of up to 10% of total energy and 80% of cooling energy when compared to workload consolidation without core capping strategy; 2) cooling energy savings up to 42% when compared to the strategy that randomly assigns jobs to all the servers and cores.},

abstract = {Approximate computing aims to trade accuracy for energy efficiency. Various approximate methods have been proposed in the literature that demonstrate the effectiveness of relaxing accuracy requirements in a specific unit. This provides a basis for exploring simultaneous use of multiple approximate units to improve efficiency under guarantees on quality of results. In this paper, we explore the effect of combining multiple approximate units on the energy consumption and identify the best setting that minimizes energy consumption under a quality constraint. Our approach also enables changes in unit configurations throughout the program. To do this effectively, we need a method to examine the combined impact of multiple approximate units on the output quality, and configure individual units accordingly. To solve this problem, we propose LEMAX that uses gradient descent approach to identify the best configuration of the individual approximate units for a given program. We evaluate the efficacy of LEMAX in minimizing the energy consumption of several machine learning applications with varying size (i.e., number of operations) under different quality constraints. Our evaluation shows that the configuration provided by LEMAX for a system with multiple approximate units improves the energy consumption by on average, 97.7%, 83.12%, and 73.95% for quality loss of 5%, 2% and 0.5%, respectively, compared to configurations obtained for a system with a single approximate resource.},

Rewards incentivise `non-green' users to be `green' as well as encouraging those users who already claim to be `green'. Measurement-based feedback improves user energy awareness and helps users to explore and adjust their use of computers to become `greener', but is not sufficient by itself. In our measurements, weekly mean group energy use as a whole reduced by up to 16%; and weekly individual user energy consumption reduced by up to 56% during active use. The findings are drawn from our longitudinal study that involved 83 Computer Science students; lasted 48 weeks across 2 academic years; monitored a total of 26778 hours of active computer use; collected approximately 2TB of raw data.},

abstract = {The optimization of software to be (more) energy efficient is becoming a major concern for the software industry. Although several techniques have been presented to measure energy consumption for software, none has addressed software product lines (SPLs). Thus, to measure energy consumption of a SPL, the products must be generated and measured individually, which is too costly.In this paper, we present a technique and a prototype tool to statically estimate the worst case energy consumption for SPL. The goal is to provide developers with techniques and tools to reason about the energy consumption of all products in a SPL, without having to produce, run and measure the energy in all of them.Our technique combines static program analysis techniques and worst case execution time prediction with energy consumption analysis. This technique analyzes all products in a feature-sensitive manner, that is, a feature used in several products is analyzed only once, while the energy consumption is estimated once per product.We implemented our technique in a tool called Serapis. We did a preliminary evaluation using a product line for image processing implemented in C. Our experiments considered 7 products from such line and our initial results show that the tool was able to estimate the worst-case energy consumption with a mean error percentage of 9.4% and standard deviation of 6.2% when compared with the energy measured when running the products.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is a key design concern in contemporary processor and system design, in the embedded domain as well as in the enterprise domain. The focus on energy efficiency has led to a number of power benchmarking methods recently. For example, EEMBC released EnergyBench and SPEC released SPECpower to quantify a system's energy efficiency; also academics have proposed power benchmarks, such as JouleSort. A major limitation for each of these proposals is that they are tied to a specific benchmark, and hence, they provide limited insight with respect to why one system may be more energy-efficient than another.This paper proposes SWEEP, Synthetic Workloads for Energy Efficiency and Performance evaluation, a framework for generating synthetic workloads with specific behavioral characteristics. We employ SWEEP to generate a wide range of synthetic workloads while varying the instruction mix, ILP, memory access patterns, and I/O-intensiveness; and we use SWEEP to evaluate the energy efficiency of commercial computer systems across the workload space and learn about how the energy efficiency of a computer system is tied to its workload's characteristics.This paper also presents the Energy-Delay Diagram (EDD), a novel method for visualizing energy efficiency. The EDD clearly illustrates the energy versus performance trade-off, and provides more intuitive insight than the traditionally used EDP and ED2P metrics.},

abstract = {Hardware dissipates energy because software tells it to. But attributing hardware energy usage to particular software functions is complicated due to distribution, resource sharing, and layering of software. To enable research on energy usage attribution, we have created the Software Energy Footprint Lab. We explain the experimental setup offered by the lab and the measurement and analysis methodology that it supports. We also describe some preliminary results aimed at deciphering hardware dissipation profiles for various types of servers under various forms of software stress. Finally, we provide an outlook of how energy footprint measurements can contribute to a body of knowledge on software-level energy optimization.},

abstract = {The design and the deployment of energy-efficient distributed systems is a challenging task, which requires software engineers to consider all the layers of a system, from hardware to software. In particular, monitoring and analyzing the power consumption of a distributed system spanning several---potentially heterogeneous---nodes becomes particularly tedious when aiming at a finer granularity than observing the power consumption of hosting nodes. While the state-of-the-art in software-defined power meters fails to deliver adaptive solutions to offer such service-level perspective and to cope with the diversity of hardware CPU architectures, this paper proposes to automatically learn the power models of the nodes supporting a distributed system, and then to use these inferred power models to better understand how the power consumption of the system's processes is distributed across nodes at runtime.Our solution, named WattsKit, offers a modular toolkit to build software-defined power meters "\`{a} la carte", thus dealing with the diversity of user and hardware requirements. Beyond the demonstrated capability of covering a wide diversity of CPU architectures with high accuracy, we illustrate the benefits of adopting software-defined power meters to analyze the power consumption of complex layered and distributed systems. In particular, we illustrate the capability of our approach to monitor the power consumption of a system composed of Docker Swarm, Weave,Elasticsearch, and Apache ZooKeeper. Thanks to WattsKit, developers and administrators are now able to identify potential power leaks in their software infrastructure.},

However, what form those impacts will take, just how large and long-lasting they will be, and whether they will ultimately be positive or negative for humanity, is far from clear. Based on surveying literature on the societal impacts of AI, we identify and discuss five potential long-term impacts of AI: how AI could lead to long-term chances in science, cooperation, power, epistemics, and values. We review the state of existing research in each of these areas and highlight priority questions for future research.},

In the last few years in the non-biological machine learning community, ensembling techniques have shown their power in data mining competitions such as the Netflix challenge; however, such methods have not found wide use in computational biology. In this work, we endeavor to show how ensembling techniques can be applied to practical problems, including problems in the field of bioinformatics, and how they often outperform other machine learning techniques in both predictive power and robustness. Furthermore, we develop a methodology of ensembling, Multi-Swarm Ensemble MSWE by using multiple particle swarm optimizations and demonstrate its ability to further enhance the performance of ensembles.},

abstract = {The ability to monitor eye closures and blink patterns has long been known to enable accurate assessment of fatigue and drowsiness in individuals. Many measures of the eye are known to be correlated with fatigue including coarse-grained measures like the rate of blinks as well as fine-grained measures like the duration of blinks and the extent of eye closures. Despite a plethora of research validating these measures, we lack wearable devices that can continually and reliably monitor them in the natural environment. In this work, we present a low-power system, iLid, that can continually sense fine-grained measures such as blink duration and Percentage of Eye Closures (PERCLOS) at high frame rates of 100fps. We present a complete solution including design of the sensing, signal processing, and machine learning pipeline; implementation on a prototype computational eyeglass platform; and extensive evaluation under many conditions including illumination changes, eyeglass shifts, and mobility. Our results are very encouraging, showing that we can detect blinks, blink duration, eyelid location, and fatigue-related metrics such as PERCLOS with less than a few percent error.},
