abstract = {Power capping is a method to save power consumption of servers by limiting performance of the servers. Although users frequently run applications on different virtual machines (VMs) for keeping their performance and having them isolated from the other applications, power capping may degrade performance of all the applications running on the server. We present fine-grained power capping by limiting performance of each application individually. For keeping performance defined in Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, it is important to estimate applications’ performance and power consumption after the fine-grained power capping is applied. We propose the estimation method of physical CPU usage when limiting virtual CPU usage of applications on VMs. On servers where multiple VMs run, VM’s usage of physical CPU is interrupted by the other VMs, and a hypervisor uses physical CPU to control VMs. These VMs’ and hypervisor’s behaviors make it difficult to estimate performance and power consumption by straightforward methods, such as linear regression and polynomial regression. The proposed method uses Piecewise Linear Regression to estimate physical CPU usage by assuming that VM’s access to physical CPU is not interrupted by the other VMs. Then we estimate how much physical CPU usage is reduced by the interruption. Because physical CPU usage is not stable soon after limiting CPU usage, the proposed method estimates a convergence value of CPU usage after many interruptions are repeated.},

abstract = {Though the energy consumption of software-controlled ICT systems ranging from mobile devices to data centers is increasingly gaining attention, energy optimization is still far from an established task in the software development process. Therefore, we have surveyed the available research on assessing the energy consumption of software systems, which showed a lack of development tools, but several approaches exist for measuring the energy consumption. We group these approaches according to how measurement data is made available and compare several characteristics of the collected data. The survey shows that not only development tools for software energy optimization are still missing, but there is also a lack of fine-grained measurement approaches as well as approaches for general-purpose platforms.},

abstract = {The development of energy-efficient software has become a key requirement for a large number of devices, from smartphones to data centers. However, measuring accurately this consumption is a major challenge that state-of-the-art approaches have tried to tackle with a limited success. While monitoring applications' consumption offers a clear insight on where the energy is being spent, it does not help in understanding how the energy is consumed. In this paper, we therefore introduce JalenUnit, a software framework that infers the energy consumption model of software libraries from execution traces. This model can then be used to diagnose application code for detecting energy bugs, understanding energy distribution, establishing energy profiles and classifications, and comparing software libraries against their energy consumption.},

abstract = {Software producing organizations have the ability to address the energy impact of their ICT solutions during the development process. However, while industry is convinced of the energy impact of hardware, the role of software has mostly been acknowledged by researchers in software engineering. Strengthened by the limited practical knowledge to reduce the energy consumption, organizations have less control over the energy impact of their products and lose the contribution of software towards energy related strategies. Consequently, industry risks not being able to meet customer requirements or even fulfill corporate sustainability goals.In this paper we perform an exploratory case study on how to create and maintain awareness on an energy consumption perspective for software among stakeholders involved with the development of software products. During the study, we followed the development process of two commercial software products and provided direct feedback to the stakeholders on the effects of their development efforts, specifically concerning energy consumption and performance, using an energy dashboard. Multiple awareness measurements allowed us to keep track of changes over time on specific aspects affecting software development. Our results show that, despite a mixed sentiment towards the dashboard, changed awareness has triggered discussion on the energy consumption of software.},

As software took control over hardware in many domains, the question of the energy footprint induced by the software is becoming critical for our society, as the resources powering the underlying infrastructure are finite. Yet, beyond this growing interest, energy consumption remains a difficult concept to master for a developer.Aims. The purpose of this study is to better understand the root causes that prevent the issue of software energy consumption to be more widely considered by developers and companies.Method. To investigate this issue, this paper reports on a qualitative study we conducted in an industrial context. We applied an in-depth analysis of the interviews of 10 experienced developers and summarized a set of implications.Results. We argue that our study delivers i) insightful feedback on how green software design is considered among the interviewed developers and ii) a set of findings to build helpful tools, motivate further research, and establish better development strategies to promote green software design.Conclusion. This paper covers an industrial case study of developers' awareness of green software design and how to promote it within the company. While it might not be generalizable for any company, we believe our results deliver a common body of knowledge with implications to be considered for similar cases and further researches.},

abstract = {The current trend of increasing energy consumption in the world has brought about two major crises for humanity. The first one is environmental pollution and the running out of energy resources. Energy supply is one of the fundamental requirements of economic development and improving the quality of human life. Since the industrial revolution in the mid-18th century, the ever-growing consumption of energy in the world has been continued. Further, Carbon Dioxide&nbsp;emitted during the&nbsp;combustion&nbsp;of fossil fuels has exerted irreversible and threatening changes in the world. Today, experts and researchers are looking for sustainable development and some strategies to reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution. Using ICT has been considered to be one of the effective solutions to achieve these goals. Due to the adverse economic and environmental consequences, as well as the continuous increase of greenhouse gas emissions, there is an emergent need to conduct some inquiries to identify the source of problems and propose some efficient coping strategies. The present study is conducted to investigate the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption, ICT&nbsp;development&nbsp;index, and economic growth. For this purpose, the data panel method was utilized for selected oil producing countries from 1998 to 2011. The results of model estimation revealed that the Kuznets hypothesis was confirmed in the period under investigation and also the development of ICT had a positive effect on reducing energy consumption and air pollution.},

abstract = {Models of energy consumption and performance are necessary to understand and identify system behavior, prior to designing advanced controls that can balance out performance and energy use. This paper considers the energy consumption and performance of servers running a relatively simple file-compression workload. We found that standard techniques for system identification do not produce acceptable models of energy consumption and performance, due to the intricate interplay between the discrete nature of software and the continuous nature of energy and performance. This motivated us to perform a detailed empirical study of the energy consumption and performance of this system with varying compression algorithms and compression levels, file types, persistent storage media, CPU DVFS levels, and disk I/O schedulers. Our results identify and illustrate factors that complicate the system's energy consumption and performance, including nonlinearity, instability, and multi-dimensionality. Our results provide a basis for future work on modeling energy consumption and performance to support principled design of controllable energy-aware systems.},

Yet, few techniques address this concern for Software Product Lines (SPL). In this paper, we therefore introduce two approaches to measure and reduce the energy consumption of a SPL by analyzing a limited set of products sampled from this SPL. While the first approach relies on the analysis of individual feature consumptions, the second one takes feature interactions into account to better mitigate energy consumption of resulting products.Our experimental results on a real-world SPL indicate that both approaches succeed to produce significant energy improvements on a large number of products, while consumption data was modeled from a small set of sampled products. Furthermore, we show that taking feature interactions into account leads to more products improved with higher energy savings per product.},

Previously we showed that the topological survivability of a power system can be quantified by analyzing the impact of all possible combinations of unrecoverable faults (fault scenarios) on the availability and connectivity of the system elements. The number of possible fault scenarios grows as 2M with increasing the number M of the system elements. Clearly, such an analysis is a computational challenge for large-scale systems.

abstract = {Discrete manufacturing is known to be a high consumer of energy and much work has been done in continuous improvement and energy saving methods addressing this issue. Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, commonly used in the manufacturing of metal parts, are highly energy-demanding because of many required sub-systems, such as cooling, lubrication, logical interfaces and electric motors. For this reason, there is a large body of work focusing on modelling the energy needs of this class of machine.This paper applies Grammatical Evolution (GE) for developing auto-regressive models for the energy consumption of a CNC machine. Empirical data from three 24-hour work shifts comprising three different types of products are used as inputs. We also introduce an autocorrelation-informed approach for the grammar, which benefits from a prior analysis of the training data for better capturing periodic or close to periodic behaviour. Finally, we compare the outcomes from real and predicted energy profiles through the use of an existing analysis tool, which is capable of extracting production-related information such as total and average KW consumption, number of parts produced and breakdown of production and idle hours. Results show that GE yields accurate and explainable models for the analysed scenario.},

abstract = {While a significant body of work in compilers has been devoted to reducing energy consumption in embedded systems, the role of a compiler in harnessing the power variation has not been widely explored. Since sharp power variations across time steps cause power supply noises and degrade reliability of functional blocks, power variation is a design constraint in embedded systems. With the advent of high performance embedded systems and extensive deployment of fine grain clock-gating, reducing variations in power is becoming increasingly important.This paper studies how compilation techniques, more specifically instruction scheduling, can ameliorate variations in power due to functional units during program execution. By extending our previous work on rate-optimal software pipelining, this paper formulates the problem of constructing a performance-optimal schedule that minimizes power variations as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The formulation can be solved using an ILP solver. We applied our approach on <tt>SPEC NAS</tt> benchmarks to construct software pipelined schedules that have minimum power variations. The benchmarks are executed on the Wattch power simulator. In comparison to the original (power-unaware) scheduler implemented in the MIPSpro compiler, our power-aware approach generates schedules which have significantly lower power variations while maintaining the same performance. Such schedules have the potential to reduce hardware cost on power delivery in designing embedded systems.},

abstract = {Energy storage plays a key element to use new energy to replace traditional coal and petrochemical energy, and it plays an important role of shifting energy utilization ways. Nowadays energy internet is a way of renewable and sharing energy. A cloud platform for monitoring energy information of thermal storage systems is developed by using cloud computing, IoT and energy storage technologies. This platform allows a user to monitor the running conditions of regional thermal energy systems in real-time from anywhere as the condition data are synchronized to the client-side website, and data are stored into a data storage server. To quickly locate any thermal energy storage system, the geographical locations of the systems built anywhere are marked on the map of the web page. The condition data of all systems can be collected and communicated between the control unit installed in the heat system and the servers on cloud. The gathered data can be worked out for further allocating energy consumption. This platform has been launched after successfully tested on a number of practical thermal energy storage systems at different regions. This will provide a guarantee for further intelligent analysis and optimization of energy deployment.},

abstract = {Software is present in all types of devices, some of them with restrictions as to the amount of energy they can spend to execute software applications. For this reason, energy costs are becoming an important factor during software development and evolution. However, there is still little support for creating energy-efficient software. In this work, we introduce a possible framework for software energy costs evaluation based on model analysis. We model software as Labelled Transitions Systems (LTS) and annotate these models with energy costs, which can be obtained using existing tools. We can then apply graph-based algorithms to traverse the models to obtain information about energy consumption related to software behaviour, such as its most/least costly execution, the cost of a specific execution, and the average cost of executing the software. No existing tool currently provides all the necessary analyses, even though they are essential for energy-consumption evaluation. We have conducted a small experiment with our framework where we employed jRAPL to measure energy costs. We annotated the models with the collected energy costs using an extended version of the LoTuS tool, where we have also implemented some of the desired analyses. Based on this support and on our initial results, we believe developers could create software more energy-efficient and consider possible trade-offs related to time, space, and energy costs when producing new versions of their systems.},

year = {2017},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The emergence of Internet of Things increases the complexity and the heterogeneity of computing platforms. Migrating workload between various platforms is one way to improve both energy efficiency and performance. Effective migration decisions require accurate estimates of its costs and benefits. To date, these estimates were done by either instrumenting the source code/binaries, thus causing high overhead, or by using power estimates from hardware performance counters, which work well for individual machines, but until now have not been accurate for predicting across different architectures. In this paper, we propose P4, a new Phase-based Power and Performance Prediction framework which identifies cross-platform application power and performance at runtime for heterogeneous computing systems. P4 analyzes and detects machine-independent application phases by characterizing computing platforms offline with a set of benchmarks, and then builds neural network-based models to automatically identify and generalize the complex cross-platform relationships for each benchmark phase. It then leverages these models along with performance counter measurements collected at runtime to estimate performance and power consumption if it were running on a completely different computing platform, including a different CPU architecture, without ever having to run it on there. We evaluate the proposed framework on four commercial heterogeneous platforms, ranging from X86 servers to mobile ARM-based architecture, with 129 industry-standard benchmarks. Our experimental results show that P4 can predict the power and performance changes with only 6.8% and 5.6% error, respectively, even for completely different architectures from the ones applications ran on.},

They either aim at improving the design time quality such as the maintainability and reusability of software artifacts, or the runtime quality such as performance and energy efficiency. However, an inherent trade-off between design- and run-time qualities is often present posing challenges to embedded software development. This work is a first step towards the investigation of the impact of transformations for improving the performance and the energy efficiency on software quality metrics and the impact of refactorings for increasing the design time quality on the execution time, the memory and the energy consumption. Based on a set of embedded applications from widely used benchmark suites and typical transformations and refactorings, we identify interrelations and trade-offs between the aforementioned metrics.},

The focus of this paper is the design of an energy efficient model for real-time early detection of A-Fib in a wearable computing device. The design is realized by incorporating an A-Fib risk factor and a real-time A-Fib incidence-based detection algorithm. The results of the design show that the proposed energy efficient model performs better than a telemetry energy model.

As the first step to achieve power-efficient ICN networks, this paper develops a power consumption model of a multicore software ICN router while taking into account the power consumed by power-hungry computation. This paper makes the following three contributions: First, the model is one of the first realistic models which consider ICN packet forwarding and packet-level caching. Second, the model is represented as a concise set of equations with just a few parameters. Third, we apply the model to estimate power consumed by simple networks.},

Green mining attempts to address this responsibility by examining the impact of software change on energy consumption. One problem with green mining is that power performance data is not readily available, unlike many other forms of MSR research. Green miners have to create tests and run them across numerous versions of a software project because power performance data was either missing or never existed for that particular project. In this paper we describe multiple open green mining datasets used in prior green mining work. The dataset includes numerous power traces and parallel system call and CPU/IO/Memory traces of multiple versions of multiple products. These datasets enable those more interested in data-mining and modeling to work on green mining problems as well.},

Many approaches tackle this problem from the point of view of different hardware components, such as CPUs, storage and network interface cards (NIC). To this date, few works focused on the energy consumption of network transfers at the software level comprising their complete stacks with different energy characteristics, and the way the NIC selection impacts the energy consumption of applications. Since data centres often install multiple NICs on each node, investigating and comparing them at the software level has high potential to enhance the energy efficiency of applications on Cloud infrastructures. We present a comparative analysis of the energy consumption of the software stack of two of today's most used NICs in data centres, Ethernet and Infiniband. We carefully design for this purpose a set of benchmark experiments to assess the impact of different traffic patterns and interface settings on energy consumption. Using our benchmark results, we derive an energy consumption model for network transfers and evaluate its accuracy for a virtual machine migration scenario. Finally, we propose guidelines for NIC selection from an energy efficiency perspective for different application classes.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity laboratory infrastructure has direct impact on the quality of student learning experiences. Because of this, the computing education field has developed a variety of approaches to designing and implementing these learning facilities. Yet, little work has gone into how to properly size cybersecurity laboratory infrastructure relative to student population and curricular compute power demands. The result has been laboratory infrastructures that do not scale with degree programs. Consequently, laboratories are either underpowered, thus limiting learning experiences, or overpowered which wastes financial resources. Accordingly, this work presents DRAT, an open-source software tool, for estimating necessary compute power in a cybersecurity engineering learning facility. More specifically, DRAT is designed to estimate the required discrete compute power on a per exercise basis in a cybersecurity engineering learning facility operating in a private cloud model. Such discrete estimations are intended to communicate physical host hardware requirements such as physical CPU core count, virtual RAM, and total Hard Disk space. The first step in designing DRAT was to forge a model estimator function. Then, we identified a series of scalar abstractions representing learning facility hardware infrastructure and behaving as conversion factors between the model function and output. Because the goal of this work was to provide estimates for cloud compute power requirements, DRAT outputs the number of physical cores, total RAM, total Disk, and total (virtual or physical) Network interfaces required to run the indicated scenario. The implication is that such estimates can inform purchasing and configuration decisions which directly impact student learning outcomes.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a new, simple, accurate, and fast power estimation technique that can be used to explore the power consumption of digital system designs at an early design stage. We exploit the machine learning techniques to aid the designers in exploring the design space of possible architectural solutions, and more specifically, their dynamic power consumption, which is application-, technology-, frequency-, and data-stimuli dependent. To model the power and the behavior of digital components, we adopt the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while the final target technology is Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The main characteristic of the proposed method, called NeuPow, is that it relies on propagating the signals throughout connected ANN models to predict the power consumption of a composite system. Besides a baseline version of the NeuPow methodology that works for a given predefined operating frequency, we also derive an upgraded version that is frequency-aware, where the same operating frequency is taken as additional input by the ANN models. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we perform different assessments at different levels. Moreover, technology and scalability studies have been conducted, proving the NeuPow robustness in terms of these design parameters. Results show a very good estimation accuracy with less than 9% of relative error independently from the technology and the size/layers of the design. NeuPow is also delivering a speed-up factor of about 84\texttimes{} with respect to the classical power estimation flow.},

abstract = {As high-performance computing (HPC) resources continue to grow in size and complexity, so too does the volume and velocity of the operational data that is associated with them. At such scales, new mechanisms and technologies are required to continuously gather, store, and analyze this data in near-real time from heterogeneous and distributed sources without impacting the underlying data center operations or HPC resource utilization. In this paper, we describe our experiences in designing and implementing an infrastructure for extreme-scale operational data collection, known as the Operations Monitoring and Notification Infrastructure (OMNI) at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. OMNI currently holds over 522 billion records of online operational data (totaling over 125TB) and can ingest new data points at an average rate of 25,000 data points per second. Using OMNI as a central repository, facilities and environmental data can be seamlessly integrated and correlated with machine metrics, job scheduler information, network errors, and more, providing a holistic view of data center operations. To demonstrate the value of real-time operational data collection, we present a number of real-world case studies for which having OMNI data readily available led to key operational insights at NERSC. The case results include a reduction in the downtime of an HPC system during a facility transition, as well as a $2.5 million electrical substation savings for the next-generation Perlmutter HPC system.},

abstract = {GreenIT has emerged as a discipline concerned with the optimization of software solutions with regards to their energy consumption. In this domain, most of the state-of-the-art solutions concentrate on coarse-grained approaches to monitor the energy consumption of a device or a process. However, none of the existing solutions addresses in-process energy monitoring to provide in-depth analysis of a process energy consumption. In this paper, we therefore report on a fine-grained runtime energy monitoring framework we developed to help developers to diagnose energy hotspots with a better accuracy than the state-of-the-art. Concretely, our approach adopts a 2-layer architecture including OS-level and process-level energy monitoring. OS-level energy monitoring estimates the energy consumption of processes according to different hardware devices (CPU, network card). Process-level energy monitoring focuses on Java-based applications and builds on OS-level energy monitoring to provide an estimation of energy consumption at the granularity of classes and methods. We argue that this per-method analysis of energy consumption provides better insights to the application in order to identify potential energy hotspots. In particular, our preliminary validation demonstrates that we can monitor energy hotspots of Jetty web servers and monitor their variations under stress scenarios.},

We present a software-based mechanism for estimating the energy consumption of sensor node at run-time. Unlike previous energy estimation mechanisms, our mechanism does not require any additional hardware components or add-ons.Our demonstration shows the energy estimation in practice on a small network of Tmote Sky motes running the Contiki operating system. A PC connected to one of the motes shows the real-time energy estimation of the network nodes and where the energy is spent: CPU active, CPU sleeping, radio transmitting, radio listening, and LEDs.},

abstract = {Software energy estimation is a critical step in the design of energy-efficient embedded systems. Instruction-level simulation techniques, despite several advances, remain too slow for iterative use in system-level exploration. In this paper, we propose a methodology called hybrid simulation, which combines instruction set simulation with selective native execution (execution of some parts of the program directly on the simulation host computer), thereby overcoming the disadvantages of instruction-level simulation (low speed) and pure native execution (estimation accuracy, inapplicability to target-dependent code), while exploiting their advantages. Previously developed techniques for software energy macromodeling are utilized to estimate energy consumption for natively executed sub-programs. We identify and address the main challenges involved in hybrid simulation, and present an automatic tool flow for it, which analyzes a given program and selects functions for native execution in order to achieve maximum estimation efficiency while limiting estimation error. We have applied the proposed hybrid simulation methodology to a variety of embedded software programs, resulting in an average speed-up of 70% and estimation error of at most 6%, compared to one of the fastest publicly-available instruction set simulators.},

However, most of the existing DNNs models for NILM use a single-task learning approach in which a neural network is trained exclusively for each appliance. This strategy is computationally expensive and ignores the fact that multiple appliances can be active simultaneously and dependencies between them. In this work, we propose UNet-NILM for multi-task appliances' state detection and power estimation, applying a multi-label learning strategy and multi-target quantile regression. The UNet-NILM is a one-dimensional CNN based on the U-Net architecture initially proposed for image segmentation. Empirical evaluation on the UK-DALE dataset suggests promising performance against traditional single-task learning.},

We apply various compression tools available on Linux to a variety of data files, and we try them on server class and workstation class systems. We compare their energy and performance results against raw reads and writes. Our results reveal that software based data compression cannot be considered as a universal solution to reduce energy consumption. Various factors like the type of the data file, the compression tool being used, the read-to-write ratio of the workload, and the hardware configuration of the system impact the efficacy of this technique. In some cases, however, we found compression to save substantial energy and improve performance.},

abstract = {Activity monitoring using Body Sensor Networks(BSN) has gained much attention from the scientific community due to its recreational and medical applications. Suggested techniques for activity monitoring face two major problem. First, systems have to be trained for the individual subjects due to the heterogeneity of the BSN data. While most solutions can address this problem on a small data set, they have no mechanics for automatic scaling of the solution as the data set increases. Second, the battery limitations of the BSN severely limit the maximum deployment time for the continuous monitoring. This problem is often solved by shifting some processing to the local sensor nodes to avoid a very heavy communication cost. However, little work has been done to optimize the sensing and processing cost of the action recognition. In this paper, we propose an action recognition approach based on the BSN repository. We show how the information of a large repository can be automatically used to customize the processing on sensor nodes based on a limited and automated training process. We also investigate the power cost of such a repository mining approach on the sensor nodes based on our implementation. To assess the power requirement, we define an energy model for data sensing and processing. We demonstrate the relationship between the activity recognition precision and the power consumption of the system during continuous action monitoring. We demonstrate the energy effectiveness of our approach with a classification accuracy constraint based on limited data repository.},

In this paper, we present and evaluate a software-based on-line energy estimation mechanism that estimates the energy consumption of a sensor node.

By implementing and evaluating the X-MAC protocol, we show how software-based on-line energy estimation can be used to empirically evaluate the energy efficiency of sensor network protocols.},

abstract = {The evolution of microprocessors has been hindered by increasing power consumption and heat dissipation on die. An excessive amount of heat creates reliability problems, reduces the lifetime of a processor, and elevates the cost of cooling and packaging considerably. It is therefore imperative to be able to monitor the temperature variations across the die in a timely and accurate manner.Most current techniques rely on on-chip thermal sensors to report the temperature of the processor. Unfortunately, significant variation in chip temperature both spatially and temporally exposes the limitation of the sensors. We present a compensating approach to tracking chip temperature through an OS resident software module that generates live power and thermal profiles of the processor. We developed such a software thermal sensor (STS) in a Linux system with a Pentium 4 Northwood core. We employed highly efficient numerical methods in our model to minimize the overhead of temperature calculation. We also developed an efficient algorithm for functional unit power modeling. Our power and thermal models are calibrated and validated against on-chip sensor readings, thermal images of the Northwood heat spreader, and the thermometer measurements on the package. The resulting STS offers detailed power and temperature breakdowns of each functional unit at runtime, enabling more efficient online power and thermal monitoring and management at a higher level, such as the operating system.},

abstract = {Improvement in the energy efficiency of supercomputers can be accelerated by improving the quality and comparability of efficiency measurements. The ability to generate accurate measurements at extreme scale are just now emerging. The realization of system-level measurement capabilities can be accelerated with a commonly adopted and high quality measurement methodology for use while running a workload, typically a benchmark. This paper describes a methodology that has been developed collaboratively through the Energy Efficient HPC Working Group to support architectural analysis and comparative measurements for rankings, such as the Top500 and Green500. To support measurements with varying amounts of effort and equipment required we present three distinct levels of measurement, which provide increasing levels of accuracy. Level 1 is similar to the Green500 run rules today, a single average power measurement extrapolated from a subset of a machine. Level 2 is more comprehensive, but still widely achievable. Level 3 is the most rigorous of the three methodologies but is only possible at a few sites. However, the Level 3 methodology generates a high quality result that exposes details that the other methodologies may miss. In addition, we present case studies from the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Calcul Qu\'{e}bec Universit\'{e} Laval that explore the benefits and difficulties of gathering high quality, system-level measurements on large-scale machines.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a problem of modeling the power consumption of advanced off-the-shelf processors. Unlike existing methods for processor power estimation, where the internal information of processor architecture such as activation of specfic modules such as pipeline stages, etc.) is available via simulation or runtime counters, power modeling method presented in this paper is to estimate the power consumption of complex off-the-shelf RISC processor without such a detailed information, only based on the information of the processor I/O signals (i.e memory access). To tackle this problem, we propose a new power model, called IPI(Instruction-Prefetch Interval) power model. The IPI represents the time interval between two consecutive instruction prefetchs. Our model has two major advantages. First, this model can consider prefetch mechanism. Most of advanced RISC processors have prefetch mechanism which makes processor power estimation difficult. IPI model is the first approach to model prefetch mechanism in processor power estimation. Second, this model can provide power variation in time and therefore it overcomes the limitation of previous work, such as instruction-level energy model. Experiments show that the proposed model yields 96% accuracy on theaverage in case of ARM1136JF-S test chip.},

Unfortunately such predictors are extremely energy consuming and in some cases not practical as they come with excessive prediction latency. One example of such predictors is the O-GEHL predictor. To achieve high accuracy, O-GEHL relies on large tables and extensive computations and requires high energy and long prediction delay.In this work we propose power optimization techniques that aim at reducing both computational complexity and storage size for the O-GEHL predictor. We show that by eliminating unnecessary data from computations, we can reduce both predictor's energy consumption and delay. Moreover, we apply information theory findings to remove redundant storage, without any significant accuracy penalty. We reduce the dynamic and static power dissipated in the computational parts of the predictor by up to 74% and 65% respectively. Meantime we improve performance by up to 12% as we make faster prediction possible.},

As a consequence, designing such application-specific IoT devices becomes a non-trivial and difficult task. In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimate power consumption of CUDA-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on GPGPUs in the design phase.

System calls are the interface between applications and the OS kernel and provide insight into how software utilizes hardware and software resources. As profiling system calls requires no specialized infrastructure, unlike energy consumption, it is much easier for the developers to track changes to system calls. Thus we relate software change to energy consumption by tracing the changes in an application's pattern of system call invocations. We find that significant changes to system call profiles often induce significant changes in energy consumption.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are essential for emerging technologies such as autonomous driving and application-specific Internet of Things(IoT) devices. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is one of the major techniques used in such systems. This leads to leveraging ML accelerators like GPGPUs to meet the design constraints. However, GPGPUs have high power consumption, and selecting the most appropriate accelerator requires Design Space Exploration(DSE), which is usually time-consuming and needs high manual effort. Neural Hardware Search(NHS) is an upcoming approach to automate the DSE for Neural Networks. Therefore, automatic approaches for power, performance, and memory estimations are needed.In this paper, we present a novel approach, enabling designers to fast and accurately estimate the power consumption of CNNs inferencing on GPGPUs with Dynamic Frequency Scaling(DFS) in the early stages of the design process. The proposed approach uses static analysis for feature extraction and Random Forest Tree regression analysis for predictive model generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can predict the CNNs power consumption with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of 5.03% compared to the actual hardware.},
