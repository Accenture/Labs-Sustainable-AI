abstract = {For green cluster computing resource management systems have to be energy-aware. CHERUB is such an energy-aware resource management system which works together with the Linux Virtual Server. Experiments in a small cluster setup with two nodes have shown the benefit of CHERUB. This paper presents necessary design changes to make CHERUB also work in big cluster setups. Our methodological approach is two-fold. First, we present unit measurements to evaluate the scaling of the re-implemented functions. Second, a cluster simulator is presented and validated which makes it possible to test CHERUB for backend clusters of arbitrary size.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of an ultra-low power cluster, built upon the Intel Edison based micro servers. The improved performance and high energy efficiency of micro servers have driven both academia and industry to explore the possibility of replacing conventional brawny servers with a larger swarm of embedded micro servers. Existing attempts mostly focus on mobile-class micro servers, whose capacities are similar to mobile phones. We, on the other hand, target on sensor-class micro servers, which are originally intended for uses in wearable technologies, sensor networks, and Internet-of-Things. Although sensor-class micro servers have much less capacity, they are touted for minimal power consumption (&lt; 1 Watt), which opens new possibilities of achieving higher energy efficiency in datacenter workloads. Our systematic evaluation of the Edison cluster and comparisons to conventional brawny clusters involve careful workload choosing and laborious parameter tuning, which ensures maximum server utilization and thus fair comparisons. Results show that the Edison cluster achieves up to 3.5x improvement on work-done-per-joule for web service applications and data-intensive MapReduce jobs. In terms of scalability, the Edison cluster scales linearly on the throughput of web service workloads, and also shows satisfactory scalability for MapReduce workloads despite coordination overhead.},

However, such energy storage devices require time for charging and increase the size, mass and cost of the system. A recent approach to address this is to power systems directly from the harvester output, termed transient computing. To solve the problem of having to restart computation from the start due to power-cycles, a number of techniques have been proposed to deal with transient power sources. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate three state-of-the-art approaches on a Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller characterizing the application scenarios where each performs best. Finally, recommendations are provided to system designers for selecting the most suitable approach.},

abstract = {Background. Often motivated by optimization objectives, software products are characterized by different subsequent releases and deployed through different strategies. The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products.Aims. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure.Method. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption.Results. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency.Conclusions. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered. The number of machines involved in a software deployment strategy does not simply constitute an additive effect of the energy consumption of the underlying hardware infrastructure.},

publisher = {EDA Consortium},
address = {San Jose, CA, USA},
abstract = {Software implementations of modern block ciphers often require large lookup tables along with code size increasing optimizations like loop unrolling to reach peak performance on general-purpose processors. Therefore, block ciphers are difficult to implement efficiently on embedded devices like cell phones or sensor nodes where run-time memory and program ROM are scarce resources. In this paper we analyze and compare the performance, energy consumption, run-time memory requirements, and code size of the five block ciphers RC6, Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish, and XTEA on the StrongARM SA-1100 processor. Most previous evaluations of block ciphers considered performance as the sole metric of interest and did not care about memory requirements or code size. In contrast to previous work, our study of the performance and energy characteristics of block ciphers has been conducted with "lightweight" implementations which restrict the size of lookup tables to 1 kB and also impose constraints on the code size. We found that Rijndael and RC6 can be well optimized for high performance and energy efficiency, while at the same time meeting the demand for low memory (RAM and ROM) footprint. In addition, we discuss the impact of key expansion and modes of operation on the overall performance and energy consumption of each block cipher. Our simulation results show that RC6 is the most energy-efficient block cipher under memory constraints and thus the best choice for resource-restricted devices.},

abstract = {Measuring software execution is important for many software engineering tasks. In this paper, Densification Power Law (DPL) of software execution is measured and studied as a feature of growing software complexity. Densification means that during a networked system's evolution, it usually becomes denser and the number of edges and nodes grows with a consistent super linear relation. This feature was discovered and reported in 2005. In this paper, based on a measurement of 15 open-source Java programs, we show that when software systems are modeled as a series of dynamic Call Graphs during their executions, they always obey DPL with very close correlation. Then a comparison between static Call Graph and DPL is presented, showing that DPL's properties cannot be derived statically. An explanation for DPL of software execution is given and verified. We believe the universality of DPL makes it an appropriate metric for software execution process.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of energy debt: a new metric, reflecting the implied cost in terms of energy consumption over time, of choosing a flawed implementation of a software system rather than a more robust, yet possibly time consuming, approach. A flawed implementation is considered to contain code smells, known to have a negative influence on the energy consumption.Similar to technical debt, if energy debt is not properly addressed, it can accumulate an energy "interest". This interest will keep increasing as new versions of the software are released, and eventually reach a point where the interest will be higher than the initial energy debt. Addressing the issues/smells at such a point can remove energy debt, at the cost of having already consumed a significant amount of energy which can translate into high costs. We present all underlying concepts of energy debt, bridging the connection with the existing concept of technical debt and show how to compute the energy debt through a motivational example.},

abstract = {Software energy consumption is a relatively new concern for mobile application developers. Poor energy performance can harm adoption and sales of applications. Unfortunately for the developers, the measurement of software energy consumption is expensive in terms of hardware and difficult in terms of expertise. Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software running within emulators or virtual machines. Some prior models require actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application.In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications. This model leverages a big-data approach whereby a collection of prior applications' energy measurements allows us to train, transmit, and apply the model to estimate any foreign application's energy consumption for a test run. Our model is based on the dynamic traces of system calls and CPU utilization.},

abstract = {How do we build artificial intelligence systems that reflect our values? Competing potential values we may want to choose from are, at their core, made up of disagreements between individual people. But while the raw datasets that most ML systems rely on are made up of individuals, today’s approaches to building AI typically abstract the individuals out of the pipeline. My thesis contributes a set of algorithms and interactive systems that re-imagine the pipeline for designing and evaluating AI systems, requiring that we deal with competing values in an informed and intentional way. I start from the insight that at each stage of the pipeline, we need to treat individuals as the key unit of operation, rather than the abstractions or aggregated pseudo-humans in use by today’s approaches. I instantiate this insight to address two problems that arise from today’s AI pipeline. First, evaluation metrics produce actively misleading scores about the extent to which some people’s values are being reflected. I introduce a mathematical transformation that more closely aligns metrics with the values and methods of user-facing performance measures. Second, the resulting AI systems either surreptitiously choose which values to listen to without input from users, or simply present several different outcomes to users without mechanisms to help them select an outcome grounded in their values. I propose a new interaction paradigm for deploying classifiers, asking users to compose a jury consisting of the individual people they’d like their classifiers’ decisions to come from.},

abstract = {Many system-level management and optimization techniques need accurate estimates of power consumption and performance. Earlier research has proposed many high-level/source-level estimation modeling works, particularly for basic blocks. However, most of them still need to execute the target software at least once on a fine-grained simulator or real hardware to extract required features. This paper proposes a performance/power prediction framework, called Deep Power Meter (DeepPM), which estimates them accurately only using the compiled binary. Inspired by the deep learning techniques in natural language processing, we convert the program instructions in the form of vectors and predict the average power and performance of basic blocks based on a transformer model. In addition, unlike existing works based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model structure, which only works for basic blocks with a small number of instructions, DeepPM provides highly accurate results for long basic blocks, which takes the majority of the execution time for actual application runs. In our evaluation conducted with SPEC2006 benchmark suite, we show that DeepPM can provide accurate prediction for performance and power consumption with 10.2% and 12.3% error, respectively. DeepPM also outperforms the LSTM-based model by up to 67.2% and 34.9% error for performance and power, respectively.},

abstract = {Cost of data centers has risen sharply in the past few years. Today, it represents about 3% of total US energy consumption with projections to increase further in the coming years. In this paper, we focus on the server infrastructure and observe that workload consolidation techniques, which maximize power efficiency of server systems, do not automatically optimize the overall system power efficiency especially when compute engines and the corresponding on-board cooling systems are considered holistically. We design SpinSmart, a framework that explores optimal server fan speeds to minimize the overall system energy consumption. We explore core capping strategies that estimate the desired number of CPU cores to be used at any given time to minimize combined CPU+fan power. Our experimental results show that we are able to achieve 1) energy savings of up to 10% of total energy and 80% of cooling energy when compared to workload consolidation without core capping strategy; 2) cooling energy savings up to 42% when compared to the strategy that randomly assigns jobs to all the servers and cores.},

The evolution from centralised cloud-hosted services towards embedded and mobile devices has shifted the focus from quality-related aspects towards the resource demand of machine learning. Its pervasiveness demands for "green" AI---both the development and the operation of AI models still include significant resource investments in terms of processing time and power demand. In order to prevent such AI Waste, this paper presents Precious, an approach, as well as practical implementation, that estimates execution time and power draw of neural networks (NNs) that execute on a commercially-available off-the-shelf accelerator hardware (i.e., Google Coral Edge TPU). The evaluation of our implementations shows that Precious accurately estimates time and power demand.},

abstract = {Approximate computing aims to trade accuracy for energy efficiency. Various approximate methods have been proposed in the literature that demonstrate the effectiveness of relaxing accuracy requirements in a specific unit. This provides a basis for exploring simultaneous use of multiple approximate units to improve efficiency under guarantees on quality of results. In this paper, we explore the effect of combining multiple approximate units on the energy consumption and identify the best setting that minimizes energy consumption under a quality constraint. Our approach also enables changes in unit configurations throughout the program. To do this effectively, we need a method to examine the combined impact of multiple approximate units on the output quality, and configure individual units accordingly. To solve this problem, we propose LEMAX that uses gradient descent approach to identify the best configuration of the individual approximate units for a given program. We evaluate the efficacy of LEMAX in minimizing the energy consumption of several machine learning applications with varying size (i.e., number of operations) under different quality constraints. Our evaluation shows that the configuration provided by LEMAX for a system with multiple approximate units improves the energy consumption by on average, 97.7%, 83.12%, and 73.95% for quality loss of 5%, 2% and 0.5%, respectively, compared to configurations obtained for a system with a single approximate resource.},

Measurement-based feedback improves user energy awareness and helps users to explore and adjust their use of computers to become `greener', but is not sufficient by itself. In our measurements, weekly mean group energy use as a whole reduced by up to 16%; and weekly individual user energy consumption reduced by up to 56% during active use. The findings are drawn from our longitudinal study that involved 83 Computer Science students; lasted 48 weeks across 2 academic years; monitored a total of 26778 hours of active computer use; collected approximately 2TB of raw data.},

abstract = {The optimization of software to be (more) energy efficient is becoming a major concern for the software industry. Although several techniques have been presented to measure energy consumption for software, none has addressed software product lines (SPLs). Thus, to measure energy consumption of a SPL, the products must be generated and measured individually, which is too costly.In this paper, we present a technique and a prototype tool to statically estimate the worst case energy consumption for SPL. The goal is to provide developers with techniques and tools to reason about the energy consumption of all products in a SPL, without having to produce, run and measure the energy in all of them.Our technique combines static program analysis techniques and worst case execution time prediction with energy consumption analysis. This technique analyzes all products in a feature-sensitive manner, that is, a feature used in several products is analyzed only once, while the energy consumption is estimated once per product.We implemented our technique in a tool called Serapis. We did a preliminary evaluation using a product line for image processing implemented in C. Our experiments considered 7 products from such line and our initial results show that the tool was able to estimate the worst-case energy consumption with a mean error percentage of 9.4% and standard deviation of 6.2% when compared with the energy measured when running the products.},

abstract = {Power consumption is becoming more and more important with the increased popularity of smart-phones, tablets and laptops. The threat of reducing a customer's battery-life now hangs over the software developer who asks, "will this next change be the one that causes my software to drain a customer's battery?" One solution is to detect power consumption regressions by measuring the power usage of tests, but this is time-consuming and often noisy. An alternative is to rely on software metrics that allow us to estimate the impact that a change might have on power consumption thus relieving the developer from expensive testing. This paper presents a general methodology for investigating the impact of software change on power consumption, we relate power consumption to software changes, and then investigate the impact of static OO software metrics on power consumption. We demonstrated that software change can effect power consumption using the Firefox web-browser and the Azureus/Vuze BitTorrent client. We found evidence of a potential relationship between some software metrics and power consumption. In conclusion, we explored the effect of software change on power consumption on two projects; and we provide an initial investigation on the impact of software metrics on power consumption.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is a key design concern in contemporary processor and system design, in the embedded domain as well as in the enterprise domain. The focus on energy efficiency has led to a number of power benchmarking methods recently. For example, EEMBC released EnergyBench and SPEC released SPECpower to quantify a system's energy efficiency; also academics have proposed power benchmarks, such as JouleSort. A major limitation for each of these proposals is that they are tied to a specific benchmark, and hence, they provide limited insight with respect to why one system may be more energy-efficient than another.This paper proposes SWEEP, Synthetic Workloads for Energy Efficiency and Performance evaluation, a framework for generating synthetic workloads with specific behavioral characteristics. We employ SWEEP to generate a wide range of synthetic workloads while varying the instruction mix, ILP, memory access patterns, and I/O-intensiveness; and we use SWEEP to evaluate the energy efficiency of commercial computer systems across the workload space and learn about how the energy efficiency of a computer system is tied to its workload's characteristics.This paper also presents the Energy-Delay Diagram (EDD), a novel method for visualizing energy efficiency. The EDD clearly illustrates the energy versus performance trade-off, and provides more intuitive insight than the traditionally used EDP and ED2P metrics.},

abstract = {The design and the deployment of energy-efficient distributed systems is a challenging task, which requires software engineers to consider all the layers of a system, from hardware to software. In particular, monitoring and analyzing the power consumption of a distributed system spanning several---potentially heterogeneous---nodes becomes particularly tedious when aiming at a finer granularity than observing the power consumption of hosting nodes. While the state-of-the-art in software-defined power meters fails to deliver adaptive solutions to offer such service-level perspective and to cope with the diversity of hardware CPU architectures, this paper proposes to automatically learn the power models of the nodes supporting a distributed system, and then to use these inferred power models to better understand how the power consumption of the system's processes is distributed across nodes at runtime.Our solution, named WattsKit, offers a modular toolkit to build software-defined power meters "\`{a} la carte", thus dealing with the diversity of user and hardware requirements. Beyond the demonstrated capability of covering a wide diversity of CPU architectures with high accuracy, we illustrate the benefits of adopting software-defined power meters to analyze the power consumption of complex layered and distributed systems. In particular, we illustrate the capability of our approach to monitor the power consumption of a system composed of Docker Swarm, Weave,Elasticsearch, and Apache ZooKeeper. Thanks to WattsKit, developers and administrators are now able to identify potential power leaks in their software infrastructure.},

For this reason, in recent years several approaches and tools for measuring the energy consumption of mobile devices have been proposed. Hardware-based solutions are highly precise, but at the same time they require costly hardware toolkits. Model-based techniques require a possibly difficult calibration of the parameters needed to correctly create a model on a specific hardware device. Finally, software-based solutions are easier to use, but they are possibly less precise than hardware-based solution. In this demo, we present PETrA, a novel software-based tool for measuring the energy consumption of Android apps. With respect to other tools, PETrA is compatible with all the smartphones with Android 5.0 or higher, not requiring any device specific energy profile. We also provide evidence that our tool is able to perform similarly to hardware-based solutions.},

Many measures of the eye are known to be correlated with fatigue including coarse-grained measures like the rate of blinks as well as fine-grained measures like the duration of blinks and the extent of eye closures. Despite a plethora of research validating these measures, we lack wearable devices that can continually and reliably monitor them in the natural environment. In this work, we present a low-power system, iLid, that can continually sense fine-grained measures such as blink duration and Percentage of Eye Closures (PERCLOS) at high frame rates of 100fps. We present a complete solution including design of the sensing, signal processing, and machine learning pipeline; implementation on a prototype computational eyeglass platform; and extensive evaluation under many conditions including illumination changes, eyeglass shifts, and mobility. Our results are very encouraging, showing that we can detect blinks, blink duration, eyelid location, and fatigue-related metrics such as PERCLOS with less than a few percent error.},
