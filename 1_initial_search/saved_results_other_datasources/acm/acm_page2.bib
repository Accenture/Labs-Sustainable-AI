abstract = {Power and performance are two potentially opposing objectives in the design of a supercomputer, where increases in performance often come at the cost of increased power consumption and vice versa. The task of simultaneously maximising both objectives is becoming an increasingly prominent challenge in the development of future exascale supercomputers. To gain some perspective on the scale of the challenge, we analyse the power and performance trends for the Top500 and Green500 supercomputer lists. We then present the Pa PW metric, which we use to evaluate the scalability of power efficiency, projecting the development of an exascale system. From this analysis, we found that when both power and performance are considered, the projected date of achieving an exascale system falls far beyond the current target of 2020.},

abstract = {Next-generation wireless technologies face considerable challenges in terms of providing the required latency and connectivity for new heterogeneous mobile networks. Driven by these problems, this study focuses on increasing user connectivity together with system throughput. For doing so, we propose and evaluate a hybrid machine learning-driven orthogonal/non-orthogonal multiple access (OMA/NOMA) system. In this work, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) to assign an OMA or NOMA access method to each user equipment (UE). As part of this research we also evaluate the accuracy and training time of the three most relevant learning algorithms of ANN (L-M, BFGS, and OSS). The main objective is to increase the sum-rate of the mobile network in the introduced beamforming and mmWave channel environment.Simulation results show up to a $20%$ sum-rate average performance increase of the system using the ANN management in contrast to a random non-ANN managed system. The Leveberg-Marquard (L-M) training algorithm is the best overall algorithm for this proposed application as presents the highest accuracy of around $77%$ despite 37 minutes of training and lower accuracy of $73%$ with approximately 28 seconds of training time.},

State-of-the-art power estimation solutions only provide coarse-grained support for power estimation. In this paper, we therefore propose a middleware for assembling and configuring software-defined power meters. Software-defined power meters provide real-time and accurate power estimation of software processes. In particular, our solution automatically learns an application-agnostic power model, which can be used to estimate the power consumption of applications.Our approach, named BitWatts, builds on a distributed actor middleware to collect process usage and infer fine-grained power consumption without imposing any hardware investment (e.g., power meters).},

abstract = {Android operating system has become one of the most popular smartphone platforms. One report stated that the most important issue of smartphones was its power consumption. Android has a function with which an application can be invoked in screen-off state without user's operation. Some applications frequently work in screen-off state, heavily and consume battery. For saving power consumption in the state, accurate estimation of power consumption of each application is important. However, estimating power consumption cannot be easily achieved because of its dependency on device. That is, application's power consumption varies on installed application and type of hardware module in the device, which can be called software and hardware dependency, respectively. In this paper, we discuss estimation of power consumption in screen-off state considering software dependency. First, we explain software dependency of power consumption. Second, we propose a method, which takes account of software dependency, for estimating power consumption due to GPS. The proposed method monitors GPS utilization individually. Third, we evaluate our method with a benchmark and practical applications using GPS. We then demonstrate that our method can estimate power consumption of each application and suitably predict consumption after uninstalling an application without uninstallation.},

abstract = {High Throughput Computing allows workloads of many thousands of tasks to be performed efficiently over many distributed resources and frees the user from the laborious process of managing task deployment, execution and result collection. However, in many cases the High Throughput Computing system is comprised from volunteer computational resources where tasks may be evicted by the owner of the resource. This has two main disadvantages. First, tasks may take longer to run as they may require multiple deployments before finally obtaining enough time on a resource to complete. Second, the wasted computation time will lead to wasted energy. We may be able to reduce the effect of the first disadvantage here by submitting multiple replicas of the task and take the results from the first one to complete. This, though, could lead to a significant increase in energy consumption. Thus we desire to only ever submit the minimum number of replicas required to run the task in the allocated time whilst simultaneously minimising energy. In this work we evaluate the use of fixed replica counts and Reinforcement Learning on the proportion of task which fail to finish in a given time-frame and the energy consumed by the system.},

Though studies have documented the share of energy consumption due to these equipment over the years, these have rarely characterized the increasing share contributed by the rapidly growing portable computing segment. The portable computing device segment is widely predicted to be a dominant mode of computing and communication, and accounting for its energy consumption is necessary for energy-efficient computing in the future. This work takes a fresh and updated look at the energy consumption due to computing devices in perspective of global consumption, and pays special attention to the contribution of portable computing devices. We further quantify the impact of energy consumed by the computing sector on the environment, as well as on the electricity cost to an average residential consumer. Finally, based on the results of the study, recommendations targeted at the computer networking community are made.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency of servers has become a significant research topic over the last years, as server energy consumption varies depending on multiple factors, such as server utilization and workload type. Server energy analysis and estimation must take all relevant factors into account to ensure reliable estimates and conclusions. Thorough system analysis requires benchmarks capable of testing different system resources at different load levels using multiple workload types. Server energy estimation approaches, on the other hand, require knowledge about the interactions of these factors for the creation of accurate power models. Common approaches to energy-aware workload classification categorize workloads depending on the resource types used by the different workloads. However, they rarely take into account differences in workloads targeting the same resources. Industrial energy-efficiency benchmarks typically do not evaluate the system's energy consumption at different resource load levels, and they only provide data for system analysis at maximum system load.In this paper, we benchmark multiple server configurations using the CPU worklets included in SPEC's Server Efficiency Rating Tool (SERT). We evaluate the impact of load levels and different CPU workloads on power consumption and energy efficiency. We analyze how functions approximating the measured power consumption differ over multiple server configurations and architectures. We show that workloads targeting the same resource can differ significantly in their power draw and energy efficiency. The power consumption of a given workload type varies depending on utilization, hardware and software configuration. The power consumption of CPU-intensive workloads does not scale uniformly with increased load, nor do hardware or software configuration changes affect it in a uniform manner.},

abstract = {Energy consumption is a growing issue in data centers, impacting their economic viability and their public image. In this work we empirically characterize the power and energy consumed by different types of servers. In particular, in order to understand the behavior of their energy and power consumption, we perform measurements in different servers. In each of them, we exhaustively measure the power consumed by the CPU, the disk, and the network interface under different configurations, identifying the optimal operational levels. One interesting conclusion of our study is that the curve that defines the minimal CPU power as a function of the load is neither linear nor purely convex as has been previously assumed. Moreover, we find that the efficiency of the various server components can be maximized by tuning the CPU frequency and the number of active cores as a function of the system and network load, while the block size of I/O operations should be always maximized by applications. We also show how to estimate the energy consumed by an application as a function of some simple parameters, like the CPU load, and the disk and network activity. We validate the proposed approach by accurately estimating the energy of a map-reduce computation in a Hadoop platform.},

Data-driven machine-learning techniques are major enablers for the modeling and interpretation of such states. Their computational energy, however, scales with the complexity of the required models. In this paper, we propose a low-energy, biomedical computation platform optimized through the use of an accelerator for data-driven classification. The accelerator retains selective flexibility through hardware reconfiguration and exploits voltage scaling and parallelism to operate at a sub-threshold minimum-energy point. Using cardiac arrhythmia detection algorithms with patient data from the MIT-BIH database, classification is achieved in 2.96 μJ (at Vdd = 0.4 V), over four orders of magnitude smaller than that on a low-power general-purpose processor. The energy of feature extraction is 148 μJ while retaining flexibility for a range of possible biomarkers.},

DVFS, however, has been mostly studied on single-chip systems with one or few cores, without considering the impact of the communication among cores. This paper evaluates the impact of frequency scaling on the performance and power of many-core systems with MPI. We conduct experiments on the Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC), an experimental many-core processor developed by Intel. The paper first introduces the run-time monitoring infrastructure and the application suite we have designed for an in-depth evaluation of the SCC. We provide an extensive analysis quantifying the effects of frequency perturbations on performance and energy efficiency. Experimental results show that run-time communication patterns lead to significant differences in power/performance tradeoffs in many-core systems with MPI.},

Such a fast computation is particularly useful for mitigating the negative impact of frequent load and generation fluctuations on the optimal operation of a large electrical grid. To this end, we decompose a given ACOPF problem by grid components, resulting in a large number of small independent nonlinear nonconvex optimization subproblems. The computation time of these subproblems is significantly accelerated by employing the massive parallel computing capability of GPUs. In addition, the warm-start ability of our method leads to faster convergence, making the method particularly suitable for fast tracking of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the performance of our method on a 70,000 bus system by solving associated optimal power flow problems with both cold start and warm start.},

abstract = {Recently, power has emerged as a critical factor in designing components of storage systems, especially for power-hungry data centers. While there is some research into power-aware storage stack components, there are no systematic studies evaluating each component's impact separately. This paper evaluates the file system's impact on energy consumption and performance. We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and file server. In case of a server node consisting of a single disk, CPU power generally exceeds disk-power consumption. However, file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power. We discovered that default file system options are often suboptimal, and even poor. We show that a carefulmatching of expectedworkloads to file system types and options can improve power-performance efficiency by a factor ranging from 1.05 to 9.4 times.},

We utilize the conducted electromagnetic interference of server power supplies to measure its power consumption from non-intrusive single-point voltage measurement. Using a pair of commercial grade Dell PowerEdge servers, we demonstrate that our approach can estimate each server's power consumption with ~3% mean absolute percentage error.},

abstract = {The increased use of IT technologies and number of IT users have triggered cloud computing resource demand including the need for more data centers. Each data center consumes electricity for its un-interrupted operations and maintenance, therefore responsible for the emissions of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas causing climate change. Hence, there is a necessity to provide a solution through which energy consumption for cloud data centers can be reduced. As virtual machine located in data center are run under loaded to maintain higher performance but it causes wastage of resources and power. While, task overloading severally reduce the performance of data center. To address this issue, we propose CMBA (Cluster and Migration Based Approach) for cloud resource allocation that maps groups of tasks to customized virtual machine types based on processing, memory and network requirements. Proper placement of workload with specific VMs and dynamic migration concept reduce energy consumption for running physical machine and its respective host or data centers.

abstract = {In performance engineering, metrics are often used to track the progress over time. Concerning the potential bias of using a single metric, performance engineers tend to use multiple metrics for reasoning. However, this approach has its own challenges. In this work we study one of the challenges in the context of analyzing trends in server energy proportionality. We examine a wide range of metrics for measuring energy proportionality, trying to determine which metrics are essential and which are redundant. We do this by comparing the trend curves of the metrics for the published results of the SPECpower_ssj2008 benchmark. While the context is specific, the proposed analysis method is quite general. We hope that this method would help us do performance engineering more effectively.},

abstract = {Global warming, which is currently one of the greatest environmental challenges, is caused by carbon emissions. A report from the Energy Information Administration indicates that approximately 98% of CO2 emissions can be attributed to energy consumption. The trade-off between efficient and ecologically sound operation represents a major challenge faced by many organizations at present. In addition, numerous companies are currently compelled to pay a carbon tax for the resources they use and the environmental impact of their products and services. Therefore, an energy consumption system can generate actual financial payback. Green information technology involves various approaches, including power management, recycling, telecommunications, and virtualization. This paper focuses on comparing and evaluating techniques used for reducing energy consumption in virtualized environments. We first highlight the impact of virtualization techniques on minimizing energy consumption in cloud computing. Then we present an experimental comparative study between two common energy-efficient task scheduling algorithms in cloud computing (i.e., the green scheduler, the power saver scheduler). These algorithms are discussed briefly and analyzed. The three metrics used to evaluate the task scheduling algorithms are (1) total power consumption, (2) data center load, and (3) virtual machine load. This work aims to gauge and subsequently improve energy consumption efficiency in virtualized environments.},

abstract = {The combination of increasing component power consumption, a desire for denser systems, and the required performance growth in the face of technology-scaling issues are posing enormous challenges for powering and cooling of server systems. The challenges are directly linked to the peak power consumption of servers.Our solution, Power Shifting, reduces the peak power consumption of servers minimizing the impact on performance. We reduce peak power consumption by using workload-guided dynamic allocation of power among components incorporating real-time performance feedback, activity-related power estimation techniques, and performance-sensitive activity-regulation mechanisms to enforce power budgets.We apply our techniques to a computer system with a single processor and memory. Power shifting adds a system power manager with a dynamic, global view of the system's power consumption to continuously re-budget the available power amongst the two components. Our contributions include:• Demonstration of the greater effectiveness of dynamic power allocation over static budgeting,• Evaluation of different power shifting policies,• Analysis of system and workload factors critical to successful power shifting, and• Proposal of performance-sensitive power budget enforcement mechanisms that ensure system reliability.},

Moreover, such devices are often always-on or running on batteries. Therefore, it is worth investigating their energy consumption to provide software developers and users with indicators for understanding how much energy the device is consuming while running a software application. In this paper, we explain a procedure for the creation of an energy consumption model of SBCs based on the usage of its components. We apply the procedure on a Raspberry PI 2 model B to test the model with a set of real applications. The results demonstrate the practical feasibility of the approach and show that estimated consumption values on our device have an average error of 2.2%, which is a good approximation without using external and expensive measuring devices.},

abstract = {Transiently powered computers (TPCs) form the foundation of the battery-less Internet of Things, using energy harvesting and small capacitors to power their operation. This kind of power supply is characterized by extreme variations in supply voltage, as capacitors charge when harvesting energy and discharge when computing. We experimentally find that these variations cause marked fluctuations in clock speed and power consumption. Such a deceptively minor observation is overlooked in existing literature. Systems are thus designed and parameterized in overly conservative ways, missing on a number of optimizations.We rather demonstrate that it is possible to accurately model and concretely capitalize on these fluctuations. We derive an energy model as a function of supply voltage and prove its use in two settings. First, we develop EPIC, a compile-time energy analysis tool. We use it to substitute for the constant power assumption in existing analysis techniques, giving programmers accurate information on worst-case energy consumption of programs. When using EPIC with existing TPC system support, run-time energy efficiency drastically improves, eventually leading up to a 350% speedup in the time to complete a fixed workload. Further, when using EPIC with existing debugging tools, it avoids unnecessary program changes that hurt energy efficiency. Next, we extend the MSPsim emulator and explore its use in parameterizing a different TPC system support. The improvements in energy efficiency yield up to more than 1000% time speedup to complete a fixed workload.},

One consequence of this model is that large cloud data centres consume large amounts of energy and produce significant carbon footprints. A common objective of cloud providers is to develop resource provisioning and management solutions that minimise energy consumption while guaranteeing Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In order to achieve this objective, a thorough understanding of energy consumption patterns in complex cloud systems is imperative. We have developed an energy consumption model for cloud computing systems. To operationalise this model, we have conducted extensive experiments to profile the energy consumption in cloud computing systems based on three types of tasks: computation-intensive, data-intensive and communication-intensive tasks. We collected fine-grained energy consumption and performance data with varying system configurations and workloads. Our experimental results show the correlation coefficients of energy consumption, system configuration and workload, as well as system performance in cloud systems. These results can be used for designing energy consumption monitors, and static or dynamic system-level energy consumption optimisation strategies for green cloud computing systems.},

Another reason behind excessive need of data centers is because of increasing number of internet users. Increasing demand of data centers simultaneously need huge amount of energy for data center operation and on other end emit enormous amount of CO2. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce energy consumption, but major concern is by looking at one parameter or criteria they must compromise on other. Our proposed approach MIPS-Aware VM Placement in combination with searching of best capable host helps to reduce VM migration and increase mean time for better performance and save energy. Proposed approach identifies overloaded and underloaded hosts and to improve system performance algorithm does not allow to allocate additional workload, which will also help to reduce energy and get better QoS. Proposed approach significantly decreases VM migration and increase mean time before VM migration which in turns helps to reduce energy and associated cost. By using proposed MIPS-Aware VM Placement approach, we can reduce upto 25% more energy consumption compared to traditional approaches.},

isbn = {9780769556970},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {As of 2010 data centers use 1.5% of global electricity production and this is expected to keep growing [1]. There is a need for a near real-time power consumption modeling/monitoring system that could be used at scale within a Software Defined Data Center (SDDC). The power consumption models and information they provide can then be used to make better decisions for data center orchestration, e.g., whether to migrate virtual machines to reduce power consumption. We propose a scalable system that would 1) create initial power consumption models, as needed, for data center components, and 2) could be continually refined while the components are in use. The models will be used for the near real-time monitoring of power consumption, as well as predicting power consumption before and after potential orchestration decisions. The first step towards this goal of whole data center power modeling and prediction is to be able to predict the power consumption of one server effectively, based on high level utilization statistics from that server. In this paper we present a novel method for modeling whole system power consumption for a server, under varying random levels of CPU utilization, with a scalable random forest based model, that utilizes statistics available at the data center management level.},

Thus, the impact and extent of the imbalance between application and system resources in exploiting energy efficient execution of server workloads is unclear. This paper proposes a trace-driven analytical model for understanding the energy performance of server workloads on ARM Cortex-A9 multicore systems. Key to our approach is the modeling of the degrees of CPU core, memory and I/O resource overlap, and in estimating the number of cores and clock frequency that optimizes energy performance without compromising execution time. Since energy usage is the product of utilized power and execution time, the model first estimates the execution time of a program.

Our analysis using these server workloads reveals that not all server workloads might benefit from higher number of cores or clock frequencies. Applying our model, we predict the configurations that increase energy efficiency by 10% without turning off cores, and up to one third with shutting down unutilized cores.

abstract = {This paper introduces GRANNITE, a GPU-accelerated novel graph neural network (GNN) model for fast, accurate, and transferable vector-based average power estimation. During training, GRANNITE learns how to propagate average toggle rates through combinational logic: a netlist is represented as a graph, register states and unit inputs from RTL simulation are used as features, and combinational gate toggle rates are used as labels. A trained GNN model can then infer average toggle rates on a new workload of interest or new netlists from RTL simulation results in a few seconds. Compared to traditional power analysis using gate-level simulations, GRANNITE achieves &gt;18.7X speedup with an error of only &lt;5.5% across a diverse set of benchmark circuits. Compared to a GPU-accelerated conventional probabilistic switching activity estimation approach, GRANNITE achieves much better accuracy (on average 25.9% lower error) at similar runtimes.},

abstract = {In the field of information and computer technology (ICT), saving energy has its focus set on energy efficient hardware and its operation. Recently, efforts have also been made in the area of computer software. However, the development of energy efficient software requires metrics, which measure the software's energy consumption as well as models to monitor and minimize it. In software and software development processes they hardly exist. In this work we present a generic metric to measure software and a method to apply it in a software engineering process.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated significant potential across a range of applications due to their superior accuracy. Edge inference, in which inference is performed locally in embedded systems with limited power resources, is researched for its energy efficiency. An approximate encoder is proposed in this study for decreasing switching activity, which minimizes power consumption in CNN accelerators at the edge. The proposed encoder performs approximate encoding based on a pattern matching of a comparison pattern and current data. Software determines the value of the comparison pattern and the availability of the recommended encoder. Experiments with a CIFAR-10 dataset utilizing LeNet5 show that using the suggested encoder, depending upon the comparison pattern, power consumption of a CNN accelerator can be reduced by 21.5% with 1.59% degradation on inference quality.},

abstract = {Computational RNA secondary structure prediction depends on a large number of nearest-neighbor free-energy parameters, including 10 parameters for Watson-Crick stacked base pairs that were estimated from experimental measurements of the free energies of 90 RNA duplexes. These experimental data are provided by time-consuming and cost-intensive experiments. In contrast, various modified nucleotides in RNAs, which would affect not only their structures but also functions, have been found, and rapid determination of energy parameters for a such modified nucleotides is needed. To reduce the high cost of determining energy parameters, we propose a novel method to estimate energy parameters from both experimental and computational data, where the computational data are provided by a recently developed molecular dynamics simulation protocol. We evaluate our method for Watson-Crick stacked base pairs, and show that parameters estimated from 10 experimental data items and 10 computational data items can predict RNA secondary structures with accuracy comparable to that using conventional parameters. The results indicate that the combination of experimental free-energy measurements and molecular dynamics simulations is capable of estimating the thermodynamic properties of RNA secondary structures at lower cost.},

However, little is known about how much software developers are concerned about energy consumption, what aspects of energy consumption they consider important, and what solutions they have in mind for improving energy efficiency. In this paper we present the first empirical study on understanding the views of application programmers on software energy consumption problems. Using StackOverflow as our primary data source, we analyze a carefully curated sample of more than 300 questions and 550 answers from more than 800 users. With this data, we observed a number of interesting findings. Our study shows that practitioners are aware of the energy consumption problems: the questions they ask are not only diverse -- we found 5 main themes of questions -- but also often more interesting and challenging when compared to the control question set. Even though energy consumption-related questions are popular when considering a number of different popularity measures, the same cannot be said about the quality of their answers. In addition, we observed that some of these answers are often flawed or vague. We contrast the advice provided by these answers with the state-of-the-art research on energy consumption. Our summary of software energy consumption problems may help researchers focus on what matters the most to software developers and end users.},

abstract = {Improving the energy efficiency of smartphones is critical for increasing the utility that they provide to the users. With most mobile operating systems, users are responsible for managing their phone's battery efficiency by utilizing the various settings provided by the operating system, as well as selecting energy-efficient apps. However, current app marketplaces do not provide users with information about app energy efficiency, which makes it challenging for the user to make informed decision when selecting an app. This paper presents a novel machine learning approach to estimate app energy efficiency by utilizing textual information available in the Google Play store such as an app's description, user reviews, as well as system permissions. Our detailed analysis of the resulting system shows that hardware permissions, app description, and user reviews correlate well with energy efficiency ratings. We evaluate five models that represent popular classes of machine learning algorithms in their ability to predict energy efficiency ratings. Finally, we compare our approach to gold truth ratings obtained by the actual energy profiling of the app, demonstrating that the proposed system is able to estimate an app's energy efficiency within less than 1 point on the 1-5 scale provided by the profiler, without requiring any kind of profiling.},

The emergence of advanced technologies such as cloud-based services, internet of things (IoT), and big data analytics has augmented the growth of global data centers, leading to high energy consumption. This upsurge in energy consumption of the data centers not only incurs the issue of surging high cost (operational and maintenance) but also has an adverse effect on the environment. Dynamic power management in a data center environment requires the cognizance of the correlation between the system and hardware-level performance counters and the power consumption. Power consumption modeling exhibits this correlation and is crucial in designing energy-efficient optimization strategies based on resource utilization. Several works in power modeling are proposed and used in the literature. However, these power models have been evaluated using different benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error-calculation formulas on different machines. In this work, we present a taxonomy and evaluation of 24 software-based power models using a unified environment, benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error formulas, with the aim of achieving an objective comparison. We use different server architectures to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the models’ comparison. The performance analysis of these models is elaborated in the article.},

abstract = {Today, cell phones have great important role in everyday lives. They are the most effective and achievable communication and computation devices that necessitate no exact time or location. Fast development of movable calculation created an energetic power to develop a synchronous technology in the markets. Anyhow movable devices are encountering with various challenges concerning available resources such as: battery, storage, bandwidth, security, and mobility. On the other side, limitation of resources in these phones has a great effect on the quality of the services. The most important limitation is the energy consuming that leads us to use the device for calculation, in spite of the accessibility of other sources. The best suggested solutions are getting rid of computation on the cloud and use of portable cloud for computation. But If there was no accessible cloud or an accurace of disconnection with the cloud, cell phones are the best to use. According to a mathematical algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization and regarding the requirement time for suitable program, we will try to introduce a dynamic way which its limitation analysis reveals that offlooding the computation considering the limitation of time leads to a less spending of power and energy resembled the current algorithm.},

However, profiling the energy consumed in the task execution is crucial to help the developers to build energy efficient applications. Therefore, the major challenge in the profiling approach is to accurately estimating the energy consumed for an application by the hardware components, such as CPU, memory, storage unit, and network interfaces. In this work, we develop and validate hardware and software profiling models and procedures. We profile smartphone CPU, where we consider multi-core CPUs and the impact of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling mechanism on the power consumption. In addition, we profile smartphone storage unit by taking into account the writing and reading rate to the unit. Moreover, we experimentally validated these profiles on two diverse smartphones with different versions of operating systems. The experimental results reveal that our profiles are able to estimate the application energy accurately.},

abstract = {Context. The rise of use cases of AI catered towards the Edge, where devices have limited computation power and storage capabilities, motivates the need for better understating of how AI performs and consumes energy. Goal. The aim of this paper is to empirically assess the impact of three different AI containerization strategies on the energy consumption, execution time, CPU, and memory usage for computer-vision tasks on the Edge. Method. In this paper we conduct an experiment with the used containerization strategy as main factor, with three treatments: ONNX Runtime, WebAssembly, and Docker. The subjects of the experiment are four widely-used computer-vision algorithms. We then orchestrate a series of runs where we deploy the four subjects on different generations of Raspberry Pi devices, with different hardware capabilities. A total of 120 runs (per device) are recorded to gather data on energy, execution time, CPU, and memory. Results. We found a statistically significant difference between the three containerization strategies on all dependent variables. Specifically, WebAssembly proves to be a valuable alternative for devices with reduced disk space and computation power. Conclusions. For computer-vision tasks with limited disk space and RAM memory requirements, developers should prefer WebAssembly for deployment. The (non-dockerized) ONNX Runtime resulted to be the best choice in terms of energy consumption and execution time.},

This paper describes a way to obtain the entire cost versus delay trade-off curve of a combinational logic circuit in an efficient way. Every point on the resulting curve is the global optimum of the corresponding gate sizing problem. The problem is solved by mapping it onto piecewise linear models in such a way, that a piecewise linear (circuit) simulator can do the job. It is shown that this setup is very efficient, and can produce trade-off curves for large circuits (thousands of gates) in a few minutes.

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel sequential framework containing two deep network architectures for baseline energy prediction of a building. The proposed framework utilizes convolution layers to extract features from the input data space without changing spatial relations between variables. These features are memorized by tensor train based gated recurrent units for an accurate long-term prediction. We observe that this sequential framework helps to improve long term prediction accuracy, thereby mitigating prediction error accumulation over time. Although architectures comprising the amalgamation of convolution layers and memory cell have shown promising results in domains such as social media analysis, language modeling, video frame prediction, and image recognition, this paper extends its scope to the context of energy applications. Furthermore, the addition of tensor train based gated recurrent units is motivated by the necessity of computational time reduction during the training process, thereby making this framework suitable for field deployment. Results on a commercial building dataset show that the current framework outperforms other existing machine learning based methods, in both short-term and long-term prediction categories.},

abstract = {Green Mining is a field of MSR that studies software energy consumption and relies on software performance data. Unfortunately there is a severe lack of publicly available software power use performance data. This means that green mining researchers must generate this data themselves by writing tests, building multiple revisions of a product, and then running these tests multiple times (10+) for each software revision while measuring power use. Then, they must aggregate these measurements to estimate the energy consumed by the tests for each software revision. This is time consuming and is made more difficult by the constraints of mobile devices and their OSes. In this paper we propose, implement, and demonstrate Green Miner: the first dedicated hardware mining software repositories testbed. The Green Miner physically measures the energy consumption of mobile devices (Android phones) and automates the testing of applications, and the reporting of measurements back to developers and researchers. The Green Miner has already produced valuable results for commercial Android application developers, and has been shown to replicate other power studies' results.},
