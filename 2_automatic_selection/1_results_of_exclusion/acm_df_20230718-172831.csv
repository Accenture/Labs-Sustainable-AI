Yet, VM-based systems are nowadays commonly used to host multiple applications for cost savings and better use of energy by sharing common resources and assets.In this paper, we propose a fine-grained monitoring middleware providing real-time and accurate power estimation of software processes running at any level of virtualization in a system. In particular, our solution automatically learns an application-agnostic power model, which can be used to estimate the power consumption of applications.Our middleware implementation, named BitWatts, builds on a distributed actor implementation to collect process usage and infer fine-grained power consumption without imposing any hardware investment (e.g., power meters). BitWatts instances use high-throughput communication channels to spread the power consumption across the VM levels and between machines. Our experiments, based on CPU- and memory-intensive benchmarks running on different hardware setups, demonstrate that BitWatts scales both in number of monitored processes and virtualization levels. This non-invasive monitoring solution therefore paves the way for scalable energy accounting that takes into account the dynamic nature of virtualized environments.","Colmant M,Kurpicz M,Felber P,Huertas L,Rouvoy R,Sobe A",,2015,2015,https://doi.org/10.1145/2741948.2741971;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2741948.2741971,process level power estimation in vm based systems,1

However, with the growing PDN size and increasing scenarios to be validated, it becomes very time- and resource-consuming to conduct full-stack PDN simulation to check the power integrity for different test vectors. Recently, various works have proposed machine learningbased methods for PDN power integrity prediction, many of which still suffer from large training overhead, inefficiency, or non-scalability. Thus, this article proposed an efficient and scalable framework for the worst-case power integrity prediction, which can handle general tasks including dynamic noise prediction and bump current prediction. The framework first reduces the spatial and temporal redundancy in the PDN and input current vector and then employs efficient feature extraction as well as a novel convolutional neural network architecture to predict the worst-case power integrity. Experimental results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the commercial tool and the state-of-the-art machine learning method with only 0.631.02% mean relative error and 2569× speedup for noise prediction and 0.221.06% mean relative error and 2464× speedup for bump current prediction.","Dong X,Chen Y,Chen J,Wang Y,Li J,Ni T,Shi Z,Yin X,Zhuo C",ACM Trans.

For the former category, even if the traffic is encrypted, an adversary performing analysis on observed traffic signatures may lead to leakage of the so called contextual information regarding the traffic. New advances in the field of machine learning also result in significantly more complex adversarial units, which may deduce different forms and uses of such contextual information. In this work, we are interested in power adaptation against an intelligent adversary which utilizes deep learning and attempts to perform predictions and time forecasting on the observed traffic traces to estimate the imminent traffic intensities. Based on its traffic predictions, the adversary might possibly activate its jamming mode and utilize its limited power more efficiently to inflict maximal damage. As a method of mitigation, the transmitter may want to increase transmitter power if it expects a higher probability of jamming, and it has a significant amount of upcoming data to transmit.

However, solutions to this problem, including static power models and canonical prediction models, either aim to build a static relationship between power consumption and hardware/application configurations without considering the dynamic fluctuation of power; or simply treat it as time series, ignoring the inherit power data characteristics. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we present a systematic power prediction framework based on extensive power dynamic profiling and deep learning models. In particular, we first analyse different power series samples to illustrate their noise patterns; accordingly we propose a power data de-noising method, which lowers noise interference to the modelling. With the pretreated data, we propose two deep learning based prediction models, including a fine-grained model and a coarse-grained model, which are suitable for different time scales. In the fine-grained prediction model, a recursive autoencoder (AE) is employed for short-duration prediction; in the coarse-grained model, an AE is used to encode massive fine-grained historical data as a further data pretreatment for long-duration prediction.

However, the signoff ECO optimization is highly time-consuming, and the power improvement is hard to predict in advance. Ever since the industrial benchmarks released by the ISPD-2012 gate-sizing contest, active research has been conducted extensively to improve the optimization process. Nonetheless, previous works were mostly based on heuristics or analytical methods whose timing models were oversimplified and lacked of formal validations from commercial signoff tools. In this article, we propose ECO-graph neural networks (GNN), a transferable graph-learning-based framework, which harnesses GNNs to perform commercial-quality signoff power optimization through discrete (Vth-assignment. One of the highlights of our framework is that it generates tool-accurate optimization results instantly on unseen netlists that are not utilized in the training process. Furthermore, we propose a subgraph approximation technique to improve training and inferencing time of the proposed GNN model. We show that design instances with non-overlapping subgraphs can be optimized in parallel so as to improve the inference time of the learning-based model. Finally, we implement a GNN-based explanation method to interpret the optimization results achieved by our framework. Experimental results on 14 industrial designs, including a RISC-V-based multi-core system and the renowned ISPD-2012 benchmarks, demonstrate that our framework achieves up to 14× runtime improvement with similar signoff power optimization quality compared with Synopsys PrimeTime, an industry-leading signoff tool.","Lu YC,Nath S,Pentapati S,Lim SK",ACM Trans.

Traditional methods infer the ammonia level by measuring the sensor's electrical resistance after it reaches equilibrium. Such a system consumes a significant amount of energy because reaching equilibrium requires heating the sensor for minutes. Our proposed approach does not wait for equilibrium, but tries to predict the resistance at equilibrium using the sensor's initial resistance response curve in a very short heating pulse (as short as 200ms). The prediction model is built on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks.We built 38 prototype sensors and a home-grown gas flow system. In a 3-month in-lab testing period, we conducted extensive experiments and collected 13,770 measurements.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is designed for IoT devices, and its received signal strength indicator (RSSI) has been used in distance and proximity estimation, though they are noisy and unreliable. In this study, we leverage the BLE TX power level in BLE models.We adopt a comparative analysis framework that utilizes our extensive data library of measurements. It considers commonly used state-of-the-art model, in addition to our data-driven proposed approach. The RSSI and TX power are integrated into several parametric models such as log shadowing and Android Beacon library models, and machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests and neural networks. Specific mobile apps are developed for the study experiment. We have collected more than 1.8 millions of BLE records between encounters with various distances that range from 0.5 to 22 meters in an indoor environment. Interestingly, considering TX power when estimating the distance reduced the mean errors by up to 46% in parametric models and by up to 35% in machine learning models. Also, the proximity classification accuracy increased by up to 103% and 70% in parametric and machine learning models, respectively.

Offline power models are able to predict the consumption accurately, but are usually intended for system design, requiring very specific and detailed knowledge about the system under consideration.In this paper, we introduce an offline power prediction method that uses the results of standard power rating tools. The method predicts the power consumption of a specific application for multiple load levels on a target server that is otherwise unavailable for testing.

Existing approaches show limitations to deliver fast yet accurate evaluation ahead of ANN deployment on the targeted hardware. In this paper, we present a modeling flow for timing and power prediction in early design stage of fully-connected ANNs on multi-core platforms. Our flow offers fast yet accurate predictions with consideration of shared communication resources and scalability in regards of the number of cores used. The flow is evaluated on real measurements for 42 mappings of 3 fully-connected ANNs executed on a clock-gated multi-core platform featuring two different communication modes: polling or interrupt-based. Our modeling flow predicts timing with accuracy and power with accuracy on the tested mappings for an average simulation time of 0.23 s for 100 iterations.

In distributed edges with servers spread across large regions, ensuring that applications are not migrated to servers too far away from their users to avoid high latency hardens the maintenance planning. In addition, the limited power supply of edge sites restricts the list of suitable alternative hosts for the applications even further. Past work has focused on optimizing maintenance or increasing the power efficiency of edge computing infrastructures. However, no work addresses both objectives together.

The proposed model takes into account processor power, bus activities, and system ambient temperature for real-time prediction on the power consumption of long running jobs. Using the HyperTransport and QuickPath Link structures as case studies and through electrical measurements on example server subsystems, we develop a chaotic time-series approximation for runtime power consumption, arriving at the Chaotic Attractor Predictor (CAP). With polynomial time complexity, CAP exhibits high prediction accuracy, having the prediction errors within 1.6% (or 3.3%) for servers based on the HyperTransport bus (or the QuickPath Links), as verified by a set of common processor benchmarks.

Some applications frequently work in screen-off state, heavily and consume battery. For saving power consumption in the state, accurate estimation of power consumption of each application is important. However, estimating power consumption cannot be easily achieved because of its dependency on device. That is, application's power consumption varies on installed application and type of hardware module in the device, which can be called software and hardware dependency, respectively.

Second, we propose a method, which takes account of software dependency, for estimating power consumption due to GPS. The proposed method monitors GPS utilization individually.

Server energy analysis and estimation must take all relevant factors into account to ensure reliable estimates and conclusions. Thorough system analysis requires benchmarks capable of testing different system resources at different load levels using multiple workload types. Server energy estimation approaches, on the other hand, require knowledge about the interactions of these factors for the creation of accurate power models. Common approaches to energy-aware workload classification categorize workloads depending on the resource types used by the different workloads. However, they rarely take into account differences in workloads targeting the same resources. Industrial energy-efficiency benchmarks typically do not evaluate the system's energy consumption at different resource load levels, and they only provide data for system analysis at maximum system load.In this paper, we benchmark multiple server configurations using the CPU worklets included in SPEC's Server Efficiency Rating Tool (SERT). We evaluate the impact of load levels and different CPU workloads on power consumption and energy efficiency. We analyze how functions approximating the measured power consumption differ over multiple server configurations and architectures. We show that workloads targeting the same resource can differ significantly in their power draw and energy efficiency. The power consumption of a given workload type varies depending on utilization, hardware and software configuration. The power consumption of CPU-intensive workloads does not scale uniformly with increased load, nor do hardware or software configuration changes affect it in a uniform manner.","v.

In particular, in order to understand the behavior of their energy and power consumption, we perform measurements in different servers. In each of them, we exhaustively measure the power consumed by the CPU, the disk, and the network interface under different configurations, identifying the optimal operational levels. One interesting conclusion of our study is that the curve that defines the minimal CPU power as a function of the load is neither linear nor purely convex as has been previously assumed. Moreover, we find that the efficiency of the various server components can be maximized by tuning the CPU frequency and the number of active cores as a function of the system and network load, while the block size of I/O operations should be always maximized by applications. We also show how to estimate the energy consumed by an application as a function of some simple parameters, like the CPU load, and the disk and network activity.

Single-chip many-core systems bring new challenges owing to the large number of operating points and the shift to message passing interface (MPI) from shared memory communication. DVFS, however, has been mostly studied on single-chip systems with one or few cores, without considering the impact of the communication among cores. This paper evaluates the impact of frequency scaling on the performance and power of many-core systems with MPI. We conduct experiments on the Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC), an experimental many-core processor developed by Intel. The paper first introduces the run-time monitoring infrastructure and the application suite we have designed for an in-depth evaluation of the SCC.

While there is some research into power-aware storage stack components, there are no systematic studies evaluating each component's impact separately. This paper evaluates the file system's impact on energy consumption and performance. We studied several popular Linux file systems, with various mount and format options, using the FileBench workload generator to emulate four server workloads: Web, database, mail, and file server. In case of a server node consisting of a single disk, CPU power generally exceeds disk-power consumption. However, file system design, implementation, and available features have a significant effect on CPU/disk utilization, and hence on performance and power. We discovered that default file system options are often suboptimal, and even poor. We show that a carefulmatching of expectedworkloads to file system types and options can improve power-performance efficiency by a factor ranging from 1.05 to 9.4 times.","Sehgal P,Tarasov V,Zadok E",,2010,2010,,evaluating performance and energy in file system server workloads,1

Systems are thus designed and parameterized in overly conservative ways, missing on a number of optimizations.We rather demonstrate that it is possible to accurately model and concretely capitalize on these fluctuations.

Several approaches have been proposed to reduce energy consumption, but major concern is by looking at one parameter or criteria they must compromise on other. Our proposed approach MIPS-Aware VM Placement in combination with searching of best capable host helps to reduce VM migration and increase mean time for better performance and save energy. Proposed approach identifies overloaded and underloaded hosts and to improve system performance algorithm does not allow to allocate additional workload, which will also help to reduce energy and get better QoS. Proposed approach significantly decreases VM migration and increase mean time before VM migration which in turns helps to reduce energy and associated cost. By using proposed MIPS-Aware VM Placement approach, we can reduce upto 25% more energy consumption compared to traditional approaches.","Bheda H,Thaker C,Shah S",,2022,2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3484824.3484894;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3484824.3484894,an optimized vm placement approach to reduce energy consumption in green cloud computing,1
85,Towards Power Consumption Modeling for Servers at Scale,"9,78077E+12",,,,Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing,"As of 2010 data centers use 1.5% of global electricity production and this is expected to keep growing [1]. There is a need for a near real-time power consumption modeling/monitoring system that could be used at scale within a Software Defined Data Center (SDDC). The power consumption models and information they provide can then be used to make better decisions for data center orchestration, e.g., whether to migrate virtual machines to reduce power consumption. We propose a scalable system that would 1) create initial power consumption models, as needed, for data center components, and 2) could be continually refined while the components are in use. The models will be used for the near real-time monitoring of power consumption, as well as predicting power consumption before and after potential orchestration decisions. The first step towards this goal of whole data center power modeling and prediction is to be able to predict the power consumption of one server effectively, based on high level utilization statistics from that server. In this paper we present a novel method for modeling whole system power consumption for a server, under varying random levels of CPU utilization, with a scalable random forest based model, that utilizes statistics available at the data center management level.","Harton TW,Walker C,O'Sullivan M",,2015,2015,,towards power consumption modeling for servers at scale,1

A trained GNN model can then infer average toggle rates on a new workload of interest or new netlists from RTL simulation results in a few seconds.

For this reason, there is a large body of work focusing on modelling the energy needs of this class of machine.This paper applies Grammatical Evolution (GE) for developing auto-regressive models for the energy consumption of a CNC machine.

Since sharp power variations across time steps cause power supply noises and degrade reliability of functional blocks, power variation is a design constraint in embedded systems. With the advent of high performance embedded systems and extensive deployment of fine grain clock-gating, reducing variations in power is becoming increasingly important.This paper studies how compilation techniques, more specifically instruction scheduling, can ameliorate variations in power due to functional units during program execution. By extending our previous work on rate-optimal software pipelining, this paper formulates the problem of constructing a performance-optimal schedule that minimizes power variations as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The formulation can be solved using an ILP solver. We applied our approach on SPEC NAS benchmarks to construct software pipelined schedules that have minimum power variations. The benchmarks are executed on the Wattch power simulator. In comparison to the original (power-unaware) scheduler implemented in the MIPSpro compiler, our power-aware approach generates schedules which have significantly lower power variations while maintaining the same performance. Such schedules have the potential to reduce hardware cost on power delivery in designing embedded systems.","Yang H,Gao GR,Leung C",,2002,2002,https://doi.org/10.1145/581630.581663;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/581630.581663,on achieving balanced power consumption in software pipelined loops,1

In this work, we introduce a possible framework for software energy costs evaluation based on model analysis. We model software as Labelled Transitions Systems (LTS) and annotate these models with energy costs, which can be obtained using existing tools. We can then apply graph-based algorithms to traverse the models to obtain information about energy consumption related to software behaviour, such as its most/least costly execution, the cost of a specific execution, and the average cost of executing the software. No existing tool currently provides all the necessary analyses, even though they are essential for energy-consumption evaluation. We have conducted a small experiment with our framework where we employed jRAPL to measure energy costs. We annotated the models with the collected energy costs using an extended version of the LoTuS tool, where we have also implemented some of the desired analyses. Based on this support and on our initial results, we believe developers could create software more energy-efficient and consider possible trade-offs related to time, space, and energy costs when producing new versions of their systems.","Duarte LM,da Silva Alves D,Toresan BR,Maia PH,Silva D",,2019,2019,https://doi.org/10.1145/3350768.3353813;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3350768.3353813,a model based framework for the analysis of software energy consumption,1

Migrating workload between various platforms is one way to improve both energy efficiency and performance. Effective migration decisions require accurate estimates of its costs and benefits. To date, these estimates were done by either instrumenting the source code/binaries, thus causing high overhead, or by using power estimates from hardware performance counters, which work well for individual machines, but until now have not been accurate for predicting across different architectures. In this paper, we propose P4, a new Phase-based Power and Performance Prediction framework which identifies cross-platform application power and performance at runtime for heterogeneous computing systems. P4 analyzes and detects machine-independent application phases by characterizing computing platforms offline with a set of benchmarks, and then builds neural network-based models to automatically identify and generalize the complex cross-platform relationships for each benchmark phase. It then leverages these models along with performance counter measurements collected at runtime to estimate performance and power consumption if it were running on a completely different computing platform, including a different CPU architecture, without ever having to run it on there. We evaluate the proposed framework on four commercial heterogeneous platforms, ranging from X86 servers to mobile ARM-based architecture, with 129 industry-standard benchmarks. Our experimental results show that P4 can predict the power and performance changes with only 6.8% and 5.6% error, respectively, even for completely different architectures from the ones applications ran on.","Kim Y,Mercati P,More A,Shriver E,Rosing T",,2017,2017,,p phase based power performance prediction of heterogeneous systems via neural networks,1

Because of this, the computing education field has developed a variety of approaches to designing and implementing these learning facilities. Yet, little work has gone into how to properly size cybersecurity laboratory infrastructure relative to student population and curricular compute power demands. The result has been laboratory infrastructures that do not scale with degree programs. Consequently, laboratories are either underpowered, thus limiting learning experiences, or overpowered which wastes financial resources. Accordingly, this work presents DRAT, an open-source software tool, for estimating necessary compute power in a cybersecurity engineering learning facility. More specifically, DRAT is designed to estimate the required discrete compute power on a per exercise basis in a cybersecurity engineering learning facility operating in a private cloud model. Such discrete estimations are intended to communicate physical host hardware requirements such as physical CPU core count, virtual RAM, and total Hard Disk space. The first step in designing DRAT was to forge a model estimator function. Then, we identified a series of scalar abstractions representing learning facility hardware infrastructure and behaving as conversion factors between the model function and output. Because the goal of this work was to provide estimates for cloud compute power requirements, DRAT outputs the number of physical cores, total RAM, total Disk, and total (virtual or physical) Network interfaces required to run the indicated scenario.

We exploit the machine learning techniques to aid the designers in exploring the design space of possible architectural solutions, and more specifically, their dynamic power consumption, which is application-, technology-, frequency-, and data-stimuli dependent. To model the power and the behavior of digital components, we adopt the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while the final target technology is Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The main characteristic of the proposed method, called NeuPow, is that it relies on propagating the signals throughout connected ANN models to predict the power consumption of a composite system. Besides a baseline version of the NeuPow methodology that works for a given predefined operating frequency, we also derive an upgraded version that is frequency-aware, where the same operating frequency is taken as additional input by the ANN models. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we perform different assessments at different levels. Moreover, technology and scalability studies have been conducted, proving the NeuPow robustness in terms of these design parameters.

Instruction-level simulation techniques, despite several advances, remain too slow for iterative use in system-level exploration. In this paper, we propose a methodology called hybrid simulation, which combines instruction set simulation with selective native execution (execution of some parts of the program directly on the simulation host computer), thereby overcoming the disadvantages of instruction-level simulation (low speed) and pure native execution (estimation accuracy, inapplicability to target-dependent code), while exploiting their advantages. Previously developed techniques for software energy macromodeling are utilized to estimate energy consumption for natively executed sub-programs. We identify and address the main challenges involved in hybrid simulation, and present an automatic tool flow for it, which analyzes a given program and selects functions for native execution in order to achieve maximum estimation efficiency while limiting estimation error. We have applied the proposed hybrid simulation methodology to a variety of embedded software programs, resulting in an average speed-up of 70% and estimation error of at most 6%, compared to one of the fastest publicly-available instruction set simulators.","Muttreja A,Raghunathan A,Ravi S,Jha NK",,2005,2005,https://doi.org/10.1145/1065579.1065590;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1065579.1065590,hybrid simulation for embedded software energy estimation,1

Unlike existing methods for processor power estimation, where the internal information of processor architecture such as activation of specfic modules such as pipeline stages, etc.) is available via simulation or runtime counters, power modeling method presented in this paper is to estimate the power consumption of complex off-the-shelf RISC processor without such a detailed information, only based on the information of the processor I/O signals (i.e memory access). To tackle this problem, we propose a new power model, called IPI(Instruction-Prefetch Interval) power model. The IPI represents the time interval between two consecutive instruction prefetchs. Our model has two major advantages. First, this model can consider prefetch mechanism. Most of advanced RISC processors have prefetch mechanism which makes processor power estimation difficult. IPI model is the first approach to model prefetch mechanism in processor power estimation. Second, this model can provide power variation in time and therefore it overcomes the limitation of previous work, such as instruction-level energy model.

We show that by eliminating unnecessary data from computations, we can reduce both predictor's energy consumption and delay. Moreover, we apply information theory findings to remove redundant storage, without any significant accuracy penalty.

Software developers as the builders and maintainers of applications, are responsible for updating and deploying energy efficient applications to end users. Unfortunately, the impact of software change on energy consumption is still unclear. Estimation based on software metrics has proved difficult. As energy consumption profiling requires special infrastructure, developers have difficulty assessing the impact of their actions on energy consumption. System calls are the interface between applications and the OS kernel and provide insight into how software utilizes hardware and software resources. As profiling system calls requires no specialized infrastructure, unlike energy consumption, it is much easier for the developers to track changes to system calls. Thus we relate software change to energy consumption by tracing the changes in an application's pattern of system call invocations. We find that significant changes to system call profiles often induce significant changes in energy consumption.","Aggarwal K,Zhang C,Campbell JC,Hindle A,Stroulia E",,2014,2014,,the power of system call traces predicting the software energy consumption impact of changes,1

In this paper, we report experimental results concerning an overlooked benefit of edge computing: energy is saved on client devices. We carried out an experimental evaluation using both software-based and hardware-based energy estimation methods.

Often motivated by optimization objectives, software products are characterized by different subsequent releases and deployed through different strategies. The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products.Aims. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure.Method. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption.Results. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency.Conclusions. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered. The number of machines involved in a software deployment strategy does not simply constitute an additive effect of the energy consumption of the underlying hardware infrastructure.","Verdecchia R,Procaccianti G,Malavolta I,Lago P,Koedijk J",,2017,2017,https://doi.org/10.1109/ESEM.2017.39;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ESEM.2017.39,estimating energy impact of software releases and deployment strategies the kpmg case study,1
167,Energy Evaluation of Software Implementations of Block Ciphers under Memory Constraints,"9,78398E+12",,,,"Proceedings of the Conference on Design, Automation and Test in Europe","Software implementations of modern block ciphers often require large lookup tables along with code size increasing optimizations like loop unrolling to reach peak performance on general-purpose processors. Therefore, block ciphers are difficult to implement efficiently on embedded devices like cell phones or sensor nodes where run-time memory and program ROM are scarce resources. In this paper we analyze and compare the performance, energy consumption, run-time memory requirements, and code size of the five block ciphers RC6, Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish, and XTEA on the StrongARM SA-1100 processor. Most previous evaluations of block ciphers considered performance as the sole metric of interest and did not care about memory requirements or code size. In contrast to previous work, our study of the performance and energy characteristics of block ciphers has been conducted with ""lightweight"" implementations which restrict the size of lookup tables to 1 kB and also impose constraints on the code size. We found that Rijndael and RC6 can be well optimized for high performance and energy efficiency, while at the same time meeting the demand for low memory (RAM and ROM) footprint. In addition, we discuss the impact of key expansion and modes of operation on the overall performance and energy consumption of each block cipher. Our simulation results show that RC6 is the most energy-efficient block cipher under memory constraints and thus the best choice for resource-restricted devices.","Großschädl J,Tillich S,Rechberger C,Hofmann M,Medwed M",,2007,2007,,energy evaluation of software implementations of block ciphers under memory constraints,1

In this paper, Densification Power Law (DPL) of software execution is measured and studied as a feature of growing software complexity. Densification means that during a networked system's evolution, it usually becomes denser and the number of edges and nodes grows with a consistent super linear relation. This feature was discovered and reported in 2005. In this paper, based on a measurement of 15 open-source Java programs, we show that when software systems are modeled as a series of dynamic Call Graphs during their executions, they always obey DPL with very close correlation. Then a comparison between static Call Graph and DPL is presented, showing that DPL's properties cannot be derived statically. An explanation for DPL of software execution is given and verified. We believe the universality of DPL makes it an appropriate metric for software execution process.","Qu Y,Zheng Q,Liu T,Li J,Guan X",,2014,2014,https://doi.org/10.1145/2593868.2593878;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2593868.2593878,in depth measurement and analysis on densification power law of software execution,1

A flawed implementation is considered to contain code smells, known to have a negative influence on the energy consumption.Similar to technical debt, if energy debt is not properly addressed, it can accumulate an energy ""interest"". This interest will keep increasing as new versions of the software are released, and eventually reach a point where the interest will be higher than the initial energy debt. Addressing the issues/smells at such a point can remove energy debt, at the cost of having already consumed a significant amount of energy which can translate into high costs. We present all underlying concepts of energy debt, bridging the connection with the existing concept of technical debt and show how to compute the energy debt through a motivational example.","Couto M,Maia D,Saraiva J,Pereira R",,2020,2020,https://doi.org/10.1145/3387906.3388628;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3387906.3388628,on energy debt managing consumption on evolving software,1

Poor energy performance can harm adoption and sales of applications. Unfortunately for the developers, the measurement of software energy consumption is expensive in terms of hardware and difficult in terms of expertise. Many prior models of software energy consumption assume that developers can use hardware instrumentation and thus cannot evaluate software running within emulators or virtual machines. Some prior models require actual energy measurements from the previous versions of applications in order to model the energy consumption of later versions of the same application.In this paper, we take a big-data approach to software energy consumption and present a model that can estimate software energy consumption mostly within 10% error (in joules) and does not require the developer to train on energy measurements of their own applications. This model leverages a big-data approach whereby a collection of prior applications' energy measurements allows us to train, transmit, and apply the model to estimate any foreign application's energy consumption for a test run.

Earlier research has proposed many high-level/source-level estimation modeling works, particularly for basic blocks. However, most of them still need to execute the target software at least once on a fine-grained simulator or real hardware to extract required features. This paper proposes a performance/power prediction framework, called Deep Power Meter (DeepPM), which estimates them accurately only using the compiled binary. Inspired by the deep learning techniques in natural language processing, we convert the program instructions in the form of vectors and predict the average power and performance of basic blocks based on a transformer model. In addition, unlike existing works based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model structure, which only works for basic blocks with a small number of instructions, DeepPM provides highly accurate results for long basic blocks, which takes the majority of the execution time for actual application runs. In our evaluation conducted with SPEC2006 benchmark suite, we show that DeepPM can provide accurate prediction for performance and power consumption with 10.2% and 12.3% error, respectively. DeepPM also outperforms the LSTM-based model by up to 67.2% and 34.9% error for performance and power, respectively.","Shim JS,Han B,Kim Y,Kim J",,2022,2022,,deeppm transformer based power and performance prediction for energy aware software,1

We design SpinSmart, a framework that explores optimal server fan speeds to minimize the overall system energy consumption. We explore core capping strategies that estimate the desired number of CPU cores to be used at any given time to minimize combined CPU+fan power.

This provides a basis for exploring simultaneous use of multiple approximate units to improve efficiency under guarantees on quality of results. In this paper, we explore the effect of combining multiple approximate units on the energy consumption and identify the best setting that minimizes energy consumption under a quality constraint. Our approach also enables changes in unit configurations throughout the program. To do this effectively, we need a method to examine the combined impact of multiple approximate units on the output quality, and configure individual units accordingly. To solve this problem, we propose LEMAX that uses gradient descent approach to identify the best configuration of the individual approximate units for a given program. We evaluate the efficacy of LEMAX in minimizing the energy consumption of several machine learning applications with varying size (i.e., number of operations) under different quality constraints. Our evaluation shows that the configuration provided by LEMAX for a system with multiple approximate units improves the energy consumption by on average, 97.7%, 83.12%, and 73.95% for quality loss of 5%, 2% and 0.5%, respectively, compared to configurations obtained for a system with a single approximate resource.","Akhlaghi V,Gao S,Gupta RK",,2018,2018,https://doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196069;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3195970.3196069,lemax learning based energy consumption minimization in approximate computing with quality guarantee,1
